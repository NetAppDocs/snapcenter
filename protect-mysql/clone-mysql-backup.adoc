[.lead]
You can use SnapCenter to clone a backup. You can clone from primary or secondary backup.

.Before you begin

* You should have backed up the resources or resource group.
* You should ensure that the aggregates hosting the volumes should be in the assigned aggregates list of the storage virtual machine (SVM).
* For pre clone or post clone commands, you should check if the commands exist in the command list available on the plug-in host from the following paths:
** Default location on the Windows host: _C:\Program Files\NetApp\SnapCenter\Snapcenter Plug-in Creator\etc\allowed_commands.config_
** Default location on the Linux host: _/opt/NetApp/snapcenter/scc/etc/allowed_commands.config_

NOTE: If the commands do not exist in the command list, then the operation will fail.
* For MySQL 5.7 version, you should set IGNORE_MYSQLX_PORT = true (by default false) in the MySQL. properties file.

.About this task

* You cannot protect the cloned MySQL instances. 

* For information about FlexClone volume split operations, see,  
https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/volumes/split-flexclone-from-parent-task.html[Split a FlexClone volume from its parent volume].

* For ONTAP 9.12.1 and earlier version, the clones created from the SnapLock Vault Snapshots as part of restore will inherit the SnapLock Vault expiry time. Storage admin should manually cleanup the clones post the SnapLock expiry time.

. In the Scripts page, perform the following steps:
+
NOTE: The scripts are run on the plug-in host.

 .. Enter the commands for pre clone or post clone that should be run before or after the clone operation, respectively.
  *** Pre clone command: delete existing databases with the same name
  *** Post clone command: verify a database or start a database.
 .. Enter the mount command to mount a file system to a host.
+
Mount command for a volume or qtree on a Linux machine:

.Steps

. Initiate a connection session with the SnapCenter Server for a specified user by using the Open-SmConnection cmdlet.
+

PS C:\> Open-SmConnection  -SMSbaseurl  https:\\snapctr.demo.netapp.com:8146/

. Retrieve the backups to perform the clone operation by using the Get-SmBackup cmdlet.
+
This example shows that two backups are available for cloning:

 C:\PS> Get-SmBackup

        BackupId                      BackupName                    BackupTime                    BackupType
        --------                      ----------                    ----------                    ----------

. Initiate a clone operation from an existing backup and specify the NFS export IP addresses on which the cloned volumes are exported.
+
This example shows that the backup to be cloned has an NFSExportIPs address of 10.32.212.14:
+
----
PS C:\> New-SmClone -AppPluginCode MySQL -BackupName "scs000211748_gdl_englab_netapp_com_MySQL_mysqld_3306_scs000211748_06-26-2024_06.08.35.4307" -Resources @{"Host"="scs000211748.gdl.englab.netapp.com";"Uid"="mysqld_3306"} -Port 3320 -CloneToHost shivarhel30.rtp.openenglab.netapp.com
----
+
NOTE: If NFSExportIPs is not specified, the default is exported to the clone target host.

. Verify that the backups were cloned successfully by using the Get-SmCloneReport cmdlet to view the clone job details.
+
You can view details such as clone ID, start date and time, end date and time.
