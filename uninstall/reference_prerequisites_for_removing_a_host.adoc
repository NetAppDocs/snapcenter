[.lead]
You can remove hosts and uninstall individual plug-ins or plug-in packages using the SnapCenter GUI. You can also uninstall individual plug-ins or plug-in packages on remote hosts using the command-line interface (CLI) on your SnapCenter Server host or using the Windows *Uninstall a program* option locally on any host.

Before you remove a host from SnapCenter Server, you should complete the prerequisites.

* You should log in as an administrator.
* If you are using SnapCenter Custom Plug-ins, you should delete all the clones from SnapCenter that are associated with the host.
* You should ensure that discovery jobs are not running on the host.
* You should be assigned a role with the required permissions to remove all of the objects associated with the host. Otherwise, the remove operation fails.
* You should confirm the fingerprint if the SSH key was modified after adding the host to SnapCenter.
* You should confirm the fingerprint if the SnapCenter host is upgraded to a later version of SnapCenter but the plug-in host is still running an earlier version of the plug-in.

== Prerequisites to remove a host using role-based access control

* You should have logged in using an RBAC role that has read, delete host, installation, uninstallation of plug-in, and delete objects permissions.
+
Objects can be clone, backup, resource group, storage system, and so on.

* You should have added the RBAC user to the RBAC role.
* You should assign the RBAC user to the host, plug-in, credential, resource groups, and storage system (for clones) that you want to delete.
* You should have logged in SnapCenter as an RBAC user.

== Prerequisites to remove a host with clones created from clone lifecycle operation

* You should have created clone jobs using clone lifecycle management for SQL databases.
* You should have created an RBAC role with clone read and delete, resource read and delete, resource group read and delete, storage read and delete, provision read and delete, mount, unmount, plug-in installation and uninstallation, host read and delete permissions.
* You should have assigned the RBAC user to the RBAC role.
* You should have assigned the RBAC user to the host, SnapCenter Plug-in for Microsoft SQL Server, credential, clone lifecycle resource group, and storage system.
* You should have logged in SnapCenter as an RBAC user.
