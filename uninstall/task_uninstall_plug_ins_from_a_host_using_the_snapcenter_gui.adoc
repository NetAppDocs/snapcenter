When you decide that you no longer require an individual plug-in or a plug-in package, you can uninstall it using the SnapCenter interface.

*What you will need*

* You should have removed the resource groups for the plug-in package that you are uninstalling.
* You should have detached the policies associated with the resource groups for the plug-in package that you are uninstalling.

*About this task*

You can uninstall an individual plug-in. For example, you might need to uninstall the SnapCenter Plug-in for Microsoft SQL Server because a host is running out of resources and you want to move that plug-in to a more powerful host. You can also uninstall an entire plug-in package. For example, you might need to uninstall the SnapCenter Plug-ins Package for Linux, which includes SnapCenter Plug-in for Oracle Database and SnapCenter Plug-in for UNIX.

* Removing a host includes uninstalling all plug-ins.
+
When you remove a host from SnapCenter, SnapCenter uninstalls all the plug-in packages on the host before removing the host.

* SnapCenter GUI removes plug-ins from one host at a time.
+
When you use the SnapCenter GUI, you can uninstall plug-ins on only one host at a time. However, you can have several uninstall operations running at the same time.
+
You can also uninstall a plug-in from multiple hosts by using the _Uninstall-SmHostPackage_ cmdlet and the required parameters. The information regarding the parameters that can be used with the cmdlet and their descriptions can be obtained by running _Get-Help command_name_. Alternatively, you can also refer to the https://library.netapp.com/ecm/ecm_download_file/ECMLP2880726[SnapCenter Software Cmdlet Reference Guide^].

IMPORTANT: Uninstalling the SnapCenter Plug-ins Package for Windows from a host on which the SnapCenter Server is installed will damage the SnapCenter Server installation. Do not uninstall the SnapCenter Plug-ins Package for Windows unless you are certain that you no longer require the SnapCenter Server.

*Steps*

. In the left navigation pane, click *Hosts*.
. In the Hosts page, click *Managed Hosts*.
. In the Managed Hosts page, select the host from which you want to uninstall the plug-in or plug-in package.
. Adjacent to the plug-in that you want to remove, click *Remove* > *Submit*.

*After you finish*

You should wait for 5 minutes before you reinstall the plug-in on that host. This time period is sufficient for the SnapCenter GUI to refresh the status of the managed host. The installation fails if you immediately reinstall the plug-in.

If you are uninstalling SnapCenter Plug-ins Package for Linux, uninstallation-specific log files are available at: _/custom_location/snapcenter/log_.
