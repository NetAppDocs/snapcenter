[.lead]
You must create a storage virtual machine (SVM) connection and a credential before using PowerShell cmdlets to back up, restore, or clone PostgreSQL clusters.

.Before you begin

* You should have prepared the PowerShell environment to execute the PowerShell cmdlets.
* You should have the required permissions in the Infrastructure Admin role to create storage connections.
* You should ensure that the plug-in installations are not in progress.
+
Host plug-in installations must not be in progress while adding a storage system connection because the host cache might not be updated and clusters status might be displayed in the SnapCenter GUI as "`Not available for backup`" or "`Not on NetApp storage`".

* Storage system names should be unique.
+
SnapCenter does not support multiple storage systems with the same name on different clusters. Each storage system that is supported by SnapCenter should have a unique name and a unique data LIF IP address.

.Steps

. Initiate a PowerShell Core connection session by using the Open-SmConnection cmdlet.
+
----
PS C:\> Open-SmConnection
----

. Create a new connection to the storage system by using the Add-SmStorageConnection cmdlet.
+
----
PS C:\> Add-SmStorageConnection -Storage test_vs1 -Protocol Https
-Timeout 60
----

. Create a new credential by using the Add-SmCredential cmdlet.
+
This example shows how to create a new credential named FinanceAdmin with Windows credentials:
+
----
PS C:> Add-SmCredential -Name FinanceAdmin -AuthMode Windows
-Credential sddev\administrator
----

. Add the PostgreSQL communication host to SnapCenter Server.
+
----
PS C:> Add-SmHost -HostName 10.232.204.61 -OSType Windows -RunAsName FinanceAdmin -PluginCode PostgreSQL
----

. Install the package and the SnapCenter Plug-in for PostgreSQL on the host.
+
For Linux:
+
----
PS C:> Install-SmHostPackage -HostNames 10.232.204.61 -ApplicationCode PostgreSQL
----
+
For Windows:
+
----
Install-SmHostPackage -HostNames 10.232.204.61 -ApplicationCode PostgreSQL -FilesystemCode scw -RunAsName FinanceAdmin
----

. Set the path to the SQLLIB.
+
For Windows, PostgreSQL plug-in will use the default path for SQLLIB folder: “C:\Program Files\IBM\SQLLIB\BIN”
+
If you want to override the default path, use the following command.
+
----
PS C:> Set-SmConfigSettings -Plugin -HostName 10.232.204.61 -PluginCode
PostgreSQL -configSettings @{“PostgreSQL_SQLLIB_CMD” = “<custom_path>\IBM\SQLLIB\BIN”}
