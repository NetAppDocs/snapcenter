Backup type specifies the type of backup that you want to create. SnapCenter supports snapshot copy-based backup type for IBM Db2 databases.

== Snapshot copy based backup

Snapshot copy-based backups leverage NetApp snapshot technology to create online, read-only copies of the volumes on which the IBM Db2 databases reside.
