Automatic discovery is not supported on Windows host. You must add Postgresql cluster resources manually.

* RDM and VMDK layouts

.Steps

. In the left navigation pane, select the SnapCenter Plug-in for Postgresql from the drop-down list, and then click *Resources*.
. In the Resources page, click *Add Postgresql resources*.
. In the Provide Resource Details page, perform the following actions:
+

+
Optional: You can click the *image:../media/add_policy_from_resourcegroup.gif[]* icon to add more volumes, LUNs, and qtrees from other storage systems.

. Review the summary, and then click *Finish*.

The clusters are displayed along with information such as the host name, associated resource groups and policies, and overall status

If you want to provide users access to resources, you must assign the resources to the users. This enables users to perform the actions for which they have permissions on the assets that are assigned to them.

* When you modify the manually added resources that are migrated from SnapCenter 5.0 or below, do the following in the *Resource Settings* page for custom key value pairs:
** Specify the term "PORT" in the *Name* field.
** Specify the port number in the *Value* field.
