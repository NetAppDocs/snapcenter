If an individual NetApp supported plug-ins resource is not part of any resource group, you can back up the resource from the Resources page. You can back up the resource on demand, or, if the resource has a policy attached and a schedule configured, then backups occur automatically according to the schedule.

.Before you begin

* You must have created a backup policy.
* If you want to back up a resource that has a SnapMirror relationship with a secondary storage, the ONTAP role assigned to the storage user should include the "`snapmirror all`" privilege. However, if you are using the "`vsadmin`" role, then the "`snapmirror all`" privilege is not required.

.Steps

. Initiate a connection session with the SnapCenter Server for a specified user by using the Open-SmConnection cmdlet.
+
----
Open-smconnection  -SMSbaseurl  https:\\snapctr.demo.netapp.com:8146\
----
+
The username and password prompt is displayed.

. Add resources by using the Add-SmResources cmdlet.
+
This example adds resources:
+
----
Add-SmResource -HostName '10.232.206.248' -PluginCode 'DB2' -ResourceName NONREC1 -ResourceType Database -StorageFootPrint ( @
{"VolumeName"="DB2_NONREC1DB";"LunName"="DB2_NONREC1DB";"Vserver"="vserver_scauto_secondary"}) -Instance db2inst1
----

. Create a backup policy by using the Add-SmPolicy cmdlet.
+
This example creates a new backup policy:
+
----
Add-SMPolicy -PolicyName 'db2VolumePolicy' -PolicyType 'Backup' -PluginPolicyType DB2  -description 'VolumePolicy'
----

. Add a new resource group to SnapCenter by using the Add-SmResourceGroup cmdlet.
+
This example creates a new resource group with the specified policy and resources:
+
----
Add-SmResourceGroup -ResourceGroupName 'Verify_ManualBackup_DatabaseLevel_MultipleVolume_unix' -Resources @(@
{"Host"="10.232.206.248";"Uid"="db2inst2\NONREC"},@{"Host"="10.232.206.248";"Uid"="db2inst1\NONREC"}) -Policies db2ManualPolicy
----

. Initiate a new backup job by using the New-SmBackup cmdlet.
+
----
New-SMBackup -DatasetName Verify_ManualBackup_DatabaseLevel_MultipleVolume_unix -Policy db2ManualPolicy
----

. View the status of the backup job by using the Get-SmBackupReport cmdlet.
+
This example displays a job summary report of all jobs that were run on the specified date:
+
----
