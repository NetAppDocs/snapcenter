You must use the SnapCenter Add Host page to add hosts, and then install the plug-in packages. The plug-ins are automatically installed on the remote hosts. You can add a host and install the plug-in packages either for an individual host or for a cluster.

.Before you begin

* You should be a user that is assigned to a role that has the plug-in install and uninstall permissions, such as the SnapCenter Admin role.
* You should ensure that the message queueing service is running.
* If you are using group Managed Service Account (gMSA), you should configure gMSA with administrative privileges.

* For Windows host, you must ensure that you select SnapCenter Plug-in for Windows.

.About this task

* You cannot add a SnapCenter Server as a plug-in host to another SnapCenter Server.

* If you install plug-ins on a cluster (WSFC), the plug-ins are installed on all of the nodes of the cluster.

.Steps

. In the left navigation pane, select *Hosts*.
. Verify that the *Managed Hosts* tab is selected at the top.
. Select *Add*.
. In the Hosts page, perform the following actions:

| For this field...| Do this...

a|
Host Type
a|
Select the host type:

 ** Windows
 ** Linux
 ** AIX

NOTE: The NetApp supported plug-ins can be used in Windows, Linux, and AIX environments.

NOTE: Storage and Oracle applications are supported on AIX. 
a|
Host name
a|
Enter the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) or the IP address of the host.

SnapCenter depends on the proper configuration of the DNS. Therefore, the best practice is to enter the FQDN.

For Windows environments, the IP address is supported for untrusted domain hosts only if it resolves to the FQDN.

You can enter the IP addresses or FQDN of a stand-alone host.

If you are adding a host by using SnapCenter and the host is part of a subdomain, you must provide the FQDN.
a|
Credentials
a|
Either select the credential name that you created, or create new credentials.

The credentials must have administrative rights on the remote host. For details, see the information about creating credentials.

You can view details about the credentials by positioning your cursor over the credential name that you specified.

NOTE: The credentials authentication mode is determined by the host type that you specify in the Add Host wizard.
|===

. In the *Select Plug-ins to Install* section, select the plug-ins to install.
+
You can install the following plug-ins from the list:

* MongoDB
* ORASCPM (displayed as Oracle Applications)
* SAP ASE
* SAP MaxDB
* Storage 

. (Optional) Select *More Options* to install the other plug-ins.

a|
Port
a|
Either retain the default port number, or specify the port number.

The default port number is 8145. If the SnapCenter Server was installed on a custom port, that port number will be displayed as the default port.

NOTE: If you manually installed the plug-ins and specified a custom port, you must specify the same port. Otherwise, the operation fails.

a|
Installation Path
a|
The NetApp supported plug-ins can be installed on either a Windows system or Linux system.

 ** For the SnapCenter Plug-ins Package for Windows, the default path is C:\Program Files\NetApp\SnapCenter.
+
Optionally, you can customize the path.

 ** For SnapCenter Plug-ins Package for Linux and SnapCenter Plug-ins Package for AIX, the default path is `/opt/NetApp/snapcenter`.
+
Optionally, you can customize the path.

a|
Skip preinstall checks
a|
Select this check box if you already installed the plug-ins manually and you do not want to validate whether the host meets the requirements for installing the plug-in.
a|
Use group Managed Service Account (gMSA) to run the plug-in services
a|
For Windows host, select this check box if you want to use group Managed Service Account (gMSA) to run the plug-in services.

IMPORTANT: Provide the gMSA name in the following format: domainName\accountName$.

NOTE: gMSA will be used as a log on service account only for SnapCenter Plug-in for Windows service.
|===

. Select *Submit*.
+
If you have not selected the *Skip prechecks* checkbox, the host is validated to verify whether the host meets the requirements for installing the plug-in. The disk space, RAM, PowerShell version, .NET version, location (for Windows plug-ins), and Java version (for Linux plug-ins) are validated against the minimum requirements. If the minimum requirements are not met, appropriate error or warning messages are displayed.
+
If the error is related to disk space or RAM, you can update the web.config file located at `C:\Program Files\NetApp\SnapCenter WebApp` to modify the default values. If the error is related to other parameters, you must fix the issue.
+
NOTE: In an HA setup, if you are updating SnapManager.Web.UI.dll.config, you must update the file on both nodes and restart the SnapCenter App Pool.
+
Windows default path is `C:\Program Files\NetApp\SnapCenter WebApp\SnapManager.Web.UI.dll.config`
+ 
Linux default path is `/opt/NetApp/snapcenter/SnapManagerWeb/SnapManager.Web.UI.dll.config`

. If host type is Linux, verify the fingerprint, and then select *Confirm and Submit*.
+
NOTE: Fingerprint verification is mandatory even if the same host was added earlier to SnapCenter and the fingerprint was confirmed.

. Monitor the installation progress.
+
The installation-specific log files are located at `/custom_location/snapcenter/` logs.
