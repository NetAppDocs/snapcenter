You must add the resources that you want to back up or clone. Depending on your environment, resources might be either database instances or collections that you want to back up or clone.

.Before you begin

* You must have completed tasks such as installing the SnapCenter Server, adding hosts, creating storage system connections, and adding credentials.
* You must have link:develop_a_plug_in_for_your_application.html[created a custom plug-in for your application].

* You must have uploaded the plug-ins to SnapCenter Server.

.Steps

. In the left navigation pane, select *Resources*, and then select the appropriate plug-in from the list.
. In the Resources page, select *Add Resource*.
. In the Provide Resource Details page, perform the following actions:
+

a|
Name
a|
Enter the name of the resource.
a|
Host name
a|
Select the host.
a|
Type
a|
Select the type. Type is user defined as per the plug-in description file. For example, database and instance.

In case the type selected has a parent, enter the details of the parent. For example, if the type is Database and the parent is Instance, enter the details of the Instance.

. In the Provide Storage Footprint page, select a storage system and choose one or more volumes, LUNs, and qtrees, and then select *Save*.
+
Optional: Select the image:../media/add_policy_from_resourcegroup.gif[Plus icon] icon to add more volumes, LUNs, and qtrees from other storage systems.

NOTE: NetApp supported plug-ins does not support automatic discovery of the resources. The storage details of physical and virtual environments are also not discovered automatically. You must provide the storage information for physical and virtual environments while creating the resources.

NOTE: Ensure that the custom keys name is in uppercase.

For the respective plug-in parameters, refer 
link:add_resources_to_netapp_supported_plugins.html#parameters-to-configure-the-resource[Parameters to configure the resource]

. Review the summary, and then select *Finish*.

.Result

The resources are displayed along with information such as type, host or cluster name, associated resource groups and policies, and overall status.

IMPORTANT: You must refresh the resources if the databases are renamed outside of SnapCenter.
//Included the above statement in 4.6 for BURT 1446035

.After you finish

If you want to provide access to the assets to other users, the SnapCenter administrator must assign assets to those users. This enables users to perform the actions for which they have permissions on the assets that are assigned to them.

After adding the resources, you can modify the resource details. If a NetApp supported plug-ins resource has backups associated with it, the following fields cannot be modified: resource name, resource type, and host name.

== Parameters to configure the resource 

If you are adding the plug-ins manually, you can use the following parameters to configure the resource in the Resource Settings page.
