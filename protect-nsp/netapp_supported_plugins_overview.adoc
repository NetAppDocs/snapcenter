You can use the NetApp supported plug-ins like MongoDB, ORASCPM (Oracle Applications), SAP ASE, SAP MaxDB, and Storage plug-in for applications that you use and then use SnapCenter to backup, restore, or clone these applications. Your NetApp supported plug-ins act as host-side components of the NetApp SnapCenter Software, enabling application-aware data protection and management of resources.

When NetApp supported plug-ins are installed, you can use SnapCenter with NetApp SnapMirror technology to create mirror copies of backup sets on another volume and use NetApp SnapVault technology to perform disk-to-disk backup replication. The NetApp supported plug-ins can be used in both Windows and Linux environments.

NOTE: SnapCenterCLI does not support NetApp supported plug-ins commands.

NetApp provides the Storage plug-in to perform data protection operations of the data volume on the ONTAP storage using the custom plug-in framework built into SnapCenter.

You can install the NetApp supported plug-ins from the Add Host page.

NOTE: SnapCenter support policy will cover support for SnapCenter custom plug-in framework, core engine, and the associated APIs. Support will not cover the plug-in source code and the associated scripts built on the custom plug-in framework.
