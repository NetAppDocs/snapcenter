= Clone from a backup

[.lead]
You can use SnapCenter to clone a backup. You can clone from primary or secondary backup. The capabilities of the clone operations depends upon the plug-in that you use.

.Before you begin

* You must have backed up the resources or resource group.
* The default clone operation only clones storage objects. Clone operations at the application level can only be performed if the NetApp supported plug-in provides that capability.
* You should ensure that the aggregates hosting the volumes should be in the assigned aggregates list of the storage virtual machine (SVM).

.About this task

For ONTAP 9.12.1 and below version, the clones created from the SnapLock Vault Snapshots as part of restore will inherit the SnapLock Vault expiry time. Storage admin should manually cleanup the clones post the SnapLock expiry time.

.Steps

. In the left navigation pane, click *Resources*, and then select the appropriate plug-in from the list.
. In the *Resources* page, filter resources from the *View* drop-down list based on resource type.
+
The resources are displayed along with information such as type, host or cluster name, associated resource groups and policies, and status.

. Select the resource or resource group.
+
You must select a resource if you select a resource group.
+
The resource or resource group topology page is displayed.

. From the Manage Copies view, select *Backups* either from the primary or secondary (mirrored or vaulted) storage systems.
. Select the data backup from the table, and then click image:../media/clone_icon.gif[clone icon].
. In the Locations page, perform the following:
+
|===
| For this field...| Do this...

a|
Clone server
a|
By default, the source host is populated.

If you want to specify a different host, select the host on which the clone should be mounted and the plug-in is installed.
a|
Clone suffix
a|
This is mandatory when the clone destination is the same as the source.

Enter a suffix that will be appended to the newly cloned resource name. The suffix ensures that the cloned resource is unique on the host.

For example, rs1_clone. If you are cloning to the same host as the original resource, you must provide a suffix to differentiate the cloned resource from the original resource; otherwise, the operation fails.

|===
If the resource selected is a LUN and if you are cloning from a secondary backup, then the destination volumes are listed. Single source can have multiple destination volumes.

. In the *Settings* page, perform the following:
+
|===
| For this field...| Do this...

a|
Initiator name
a|
Enter the host initiator name, which is either a IQDN or WWPN.
a|
Igroup protocol
a|
Select Igroup protocol.
|===
NOTE: Settings page is displayed only if the storage type is LUN.

. In the Scripts page, enter the commands for pre clone or post clone that should be run before or after the clone operation, respectively. Enter the mount command to mount a file system to a host.
+
For example:
+
* Pre clone command: delete existing databases with the same name
+
* Post clone command: verify a database or start a database.
+
Mount command for a volume or qtree on a Linux machine: mount<VSERVER_NAME>:%<VOLUME_NAME_Clone /mnt>

. In the *Notification* page, from the *Email preference* drop-down list, select the scenarios in which you want to send the emails.
+
You must also specify the sender and receiver email addresses, and the subject of the email.

. Review the summary and click *Finish*.
. Monitor the operation progress by clicking *Monitor* > *Jobs*.
