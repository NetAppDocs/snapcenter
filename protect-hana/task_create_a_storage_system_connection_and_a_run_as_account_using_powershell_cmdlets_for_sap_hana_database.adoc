= Create a storage system connection and a credential using PowerShell cmdlets for SAP HANA database

[.lead]
You must create a storage virtual machine (SVM) connection and a credential before using PowerShell cmdlets to back up, restore, or clone SAP HANA databases.

*What you will need*

* You should have prepared the PowerShell environment to execute the PowerShell cmdlets.
* You should have the required permissions in the Infrastructure Admin role to create storage connections.
* You should ensure that the plug-in installations are not in progress.
+
Host plug-in installations must not be in progress while adding a storage system connection because the host cache might not be updated and databases status might be displayed in the SnapCenter GUI as "`Not available for backup`" or "`Not on NetApp storage`".

* Storage system names should be unique.
+
SnapCenter does not support multiple storage systems with the same name on different clusters. Each storage system that is supported by SnapCenter should have a unique name and a unique data LIF IP address.

*Steps*

. Initiate a PowerShell connection session by using the Open-SmConnection cmdlet.
+
----
PS C:\> Open-SmStorageConnection
----

. Create a new connection to the storage system by using the Add-SmStorageConnection cmdlet.
+
----
PS C:\> Add-SmStorageConnection -Storage test_vs1 -Protocol Https
-Timeout 60
----

. Create a new credential by using the Add-SmCredential cmdlet.
+
This example shows how to create a new credential named FinanceAdmin with Windows credentials:
+
----
PS C:> Add-SmCredential -Name FinanceAdmin -AuthMode Windows
-Credential sddev\administrator
----

. Add the SAP HANA communication host to SnapCenter Server.
+
----
PS C:> Add-SmHost -HostName 10.232.204.61 -OSType Windows -RunAsName FinanceAdmin -PluginCode hana
----

. Install the package and the SnapCenter Plug-in for SAP HANA Database on the host.
+
For Linux:
+
----
PS C:> Install-SmHostPackage -HostNames 10.232.204.61 -ApplicationCode hana
----
+
For Windows:
+
----
Install-SmHostPackage -HostNames 10.232.204.61 -ApplicationCode hana -FilesystemCode scw -RunAsName FinanceAdmin
----

. Set the path to the HDBSQL client.
+
For Windows:
+
----
PS C:> Set-SmConfigSettings -Plugin -HostName 10.232.204.61 -PluginCode hana -configSettings @{"HANA_HDBSQL_CMD" = "C:\Program Files\sap\hdbclient\hdbsql.exe"}
----
+
For Linux:
+
----
Set-SmConfigSettings -Plugin -HostName scs-hana.gdl.englab.netapp.com -PluginCode hana -configSettings @{"HANA_HDBSQL_CMD"="/usr/sap/hdbclient/hdbsql"}
----
