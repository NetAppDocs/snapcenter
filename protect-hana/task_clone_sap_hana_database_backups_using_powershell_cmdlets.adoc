[.lead]
The clone workflow includes planning, performing the clone operation, and monitoring the operation.

You must have prepared the PowerShell environment to execute the PowerShell cmdlets.

The information regarding the parameters that can be used with the cmdlet and their descriptions can be obtained by running _Get-Help command_name_. Alternatively, you can also refer to the https://library.netapp.com/ecm/ecm_download_file/ECMLP2880726[SnapCenter Software Cmdlet Reference Guide^].

*Steps*

. Initiate a connection session with the SnapCenter Server for a specified user by using the Open-SmConnection cmdlet.

----

. Retrieve the backups to perform the clone operation by using the Get-SmBackup cmdlet.
+
This example shows that two backups are available for cloning:
+
----
 C:\PS> Get-SmBackup

        BackupId                      BackupName                    BackupTime                    BackupType
        --------                      ----------                    ----------                    ----------
         1                     Payroll Dataset_vise-f6_08... 8/4/2015 11:02:32 AM          Full Backup
         2                     Payroll Dataset_vise-f6_08... 8/4/2015 11:23:17 AM
----

. Initiate a clone operation from an existing backup and specify the NFS export IP addresses on which the cloned volumes are exported.
+
This example shows that the backup to be cloned has an NFSExportIPs address of 10.232.206.169:
+
----
New-SmClone -AppPluginCode hana -BackupName scsccore1_sccore_test_com_hana_H73_scsccore1_06-07-2017_02.54.29.3817 -Resources @{"Host"="scsccore1.sccore.test.com";"Uid"="H73"}  -CloneToInstance shivscc4.sccore.test.com -mountcommand 'mount 10.232.206.169:%hana73data_Clone /hana83data' -preclonecreatecommands '/home/scripts/scpre_clone.sh' -postclonecreatecommands '/home/scripts/scpost_clone.sh'
----
+
NOTE: If NFSExportIPs is not specified, the default is exported to the clone target host.

. Verify that the backups were cloned successfully by using the Get-SmCloneReport cmdlet to view the clone job details.
+
You can view details such as clone ID, start date and time, end date and time.
+
