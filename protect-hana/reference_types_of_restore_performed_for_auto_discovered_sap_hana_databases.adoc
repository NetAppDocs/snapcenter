SnapCenter supports volume-based SnapRestore (VBSR), Single File SnapRestore, and connect-and-copy restore types for automatically discovered SAP HANA databases.

== Volume-based SnapRestore (VBSR) is performed in NFS environments for the following scenarios:

* When the backup selected for restore is taken on releases earlier than SnapCenter 4.3, and only if the **Complete Resource**option is selected
* When the backup selected for restore is taken in SnapCenter 4.3, and if the *Volume Revert* option is selected

== Single File SnapRestore is performed in NFS environments for the following scenarios:

* When the backup selected for restore is taken in SnapCenter 4.3, and if only the *Complete Resource* option is selected
* For multitenant database containers (MDC), when the backup selected for restore is taken on SnapCenter 4.3, and the *Tenant Database* option is selected
* When the backup selected is from a SnapMirror or SnapVault secondary location, and the *Complete Resource* option is selected

== Single File SnapRestore is performed in SAN environments for the following scenarios:

* When backups are taken on releases earlier than SnapCenter 4.3, and only if the *Complete Resource* option is selected
* When backups are taken in SnapCenter 4.3, and only if the *Complete Resource* option is selected
* When the backup is selected from a SnapMirror or SnapVault secondary location, and the *Complete Resource* option is selected

== Connect-and-copy based restore is performed in SAN environments for the following scenario:

* For MDC, when the backup selected for restore is taken in SnapCenter 4.3, and the *Tenant Database* option is selected

NOTE: *Complete Resource*, *Volume Revert*, and *Tenant Database* options are available on the Restore Scope page.
