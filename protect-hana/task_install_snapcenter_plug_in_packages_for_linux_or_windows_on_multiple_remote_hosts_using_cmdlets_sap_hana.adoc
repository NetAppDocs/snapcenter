You can install the SnapCenter Plug-in Packages for Linux or Windows on multiple hosts simultaneously by using the Install-SmHostPackage PowerShell cmdlet.

*What you will need*

You must have logged in to SnapCenter as a domain user with local administrator rights on each host on which you want to install the plug-in package.

*Steps*

. Launch PowerShell.
. On the SnapCenter Server host, establish a session using the Open-SmConnection cmdlet, and then enter your credentials.
. Install the plug-in on multiple hosts using the Install-SmHostPackage cmdlet and the required parameters.
+
The information regarding the parameters that can be used with the cmdlet and their descriptions can be obtained by running _Get-Help command_name_. Alternatively, you can also refer to the https://library.netapp.com/ecm/ecm_download_file/ECMLP2883300[SnapCenter Software Cmdlet Reference Guide^].
+
You can use the -skipprecheck option when you have installed the plug-ins manually and do not want to validate whether the host meets the requirements to install the plug-in.

. Enter your credentials for remote installation.
