A resource group is a collection of resources on a host. A backup operation on the resource group is performed on all resources defined in the resource group.

*What you will need*

* You must have created a resource group with a policy attached.
* If you want to back up a resource that has a SnapMirror relationship with a secondary storage, the ONTAP role assigned to the storage user should include the "`snapmirror all`" privilege. However, if you are using the "`vsadmin`" role, then the "`snapmirror all`" privilege is not required.

*About this task*

You can back up a resource group on demand from the *Resources* page. If a resource group has a policy attached and a schedule configured, then backups occur automatically according to the schedule.

. In the left navigation pane, click *Resources*, and then select the appropriate plug-in from the list.
. In the Resources page, select *Resource Group* from the *View* list.
+
You can search the resource group either by entering the resource group name in the search box or by clicking image:../media/filter_icon.gif[], and then selecting the tag. You can then click image:../media/filter_icon.gif[] to close the filter pane.

*Steps*

. In the Resource Groups page, select the resource group that you want to back up, and then click *Back up Now*.
. In the Backup page, perform the following steps:
 .. If you associated multiple policies with the resource group, from the *Policy* drop-down list, select the policy that you want to use for backup.
+
If the policy selected for the on-demand backup is associated with a backup schedule, the on-demand backups will be retained based on the retention settings specified for the schedule type.

 .. Click *Backup*.
. Monitor the operation progress by clicking *Monitor* > *Jobs*.
