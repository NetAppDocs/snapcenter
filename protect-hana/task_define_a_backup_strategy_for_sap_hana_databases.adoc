Defining a backup strategy before you create your backup jobs helps you to have the backups that you require to successfully restore or clone your resources. Your service-level agreement (SLA), recovery time objective (RTO), and recovery point objective (RPO) largely determine your backup strategy.

*About this task*

An SLA defines the level of service that is expected and addresses many service-related issues, including the availability and performance of the service. RTO is the time by which a business process must be restored after a disruption in service. RPO defines the strategy for the age of the files that must be recovered from backup storage for regular operations to resume after a failure. SLA, RTO, and RPO contribute to the data protection strategy.

*Steps*

. Determine when you should back up your resources.
. Decide how many backup jobs you require.
. Decide how to name your backups.
. Decide whether you want to create a Snapshot copy-based policy to back up application-consistent Snapshot copies of the database.
. Decide whether you want to verify the integrity of the database.
. Decide whether you want to use NetApp SnapMirror technology for replication or NetApp SnapVault technology for long-term retention.
. Determine the retention period for the Snapshot copies on the source storage system and the SnapMirror destination.
. Determine whether you want to run any commands before or after the backup operation and provide a prescript or postscript.
