SnapCenter manages the housekeeping of log and data backups on the storage system and file system levels, and within the SAP HANA backup catalog.

The Snapshot copies on the primary or secondary storage and their corresponding entries in the SAP HANA catalog are deleted based on the retention settings. The SAP HANA catalog entries are also deleted during backup and resource group deletion.
