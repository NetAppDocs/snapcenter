You should install the SnapCenter Plug-in for SAP HANA Database by using the SnapCenter user interface (UI). If your environment does not allow remote installation of the plug-in from the SnapCenter UI, you can install the Plug-in for SAP HANA Database either in console mode or in silent mode by using the command-line interface (CLI).

*What you will need*

* You should install the Plug-in for SAP HANA Database on each of the Linux host where the HDBSQL client resides.
* The Linux host on which you are installing the SnapCenter Plug-in for SAP HANA Database must meet the dependent software, database, and operating system requirements.
+
The Interoperability Matrix Tool (IMT) contains the latest information about the supported configurations.

* The SnapCenter Plug-in for SAP HANA Database is part of SnapCenter Plug-ins Package for Linux. Before you install SnapCenter Plug-ins Package for Linux, you should have already installed SnapCenter on a Windows host.

*Steps*

. Copy the SnapCenter Plug-ins Package for Linux installation file (snapcenter_linux_host_plugin.bin) from C:\ProgramData\NetApp\SnapCenter\Package Repository to the host where you want to install the Plug-in for SAP HANA Database.
+
You can access this path from the host where the SnapCenter Server is installed.

. From the command prompt, navigate to the directory where you copied the installation file.
. Install the plug-in: `path_to_installation_bin_file/snapcenter_linux_host_plugin.bin -i silent -DPORT=port_number_for_host -DSERVER_IP=server_name_or_ip_address -DSERVER_HTTPS_PORT=port_number_for_server`
 ** -DPORT specifies the SMCore HTTPS communication port.
 ** -DSERVER_IP specifies the SnapCenter Server IP address.
 ** -DSERVER_HTTPS_PORT specifies the SnapCenter Server HTTPS port.
 ** -DUSER_INSTALL_DIR specifies the directory where you want to install the SnapCenter Plug-ins Package for Linux.
 ** DINSTALL_LOG_NAME specifies the name of the log file.
