= Clone a SAP HANA database backup

[.lead]
You can use SnapCenter to clone a backup. You can clone from primary or secondary backup.

.Before you begin

* You should have backed up the resources or resource group.
* You should ensure that the aggregates hosting the volumes should be in the assigned aggregates list of the storage virtual machine (SVM).
* You cannot clone file-based backups.
* The target clone server should have the same SAP HANA instance SID that is provided in the Target Clone SID field.
* For pre clone or post clone commands, you should check if the commands exist in the command list available on the plug-in host from the following paths:
** For Windows: _C:\Program Files\NetApp\SnapCenter\Snapcenter Plug-in Creator\etc\allowed_commands.config_
** For Linux: _/opt/NetApp/snapcenter/scc/etc/allowed_commands.config_

NOTE: If the commands do not exist in the command list, then the operation will fail.

.About this task

* For information about clone split operation limitations, see http://docs.netapp.com/ontap-9/topic/com.netapp.doc.dot-cm-vsmg/home.html[ONTAP 9 Logical Storage Management Guide^].

* For ONTAP 9.12.1 and earlier version, the clones created from the SnapLock Vault Snapshots as part of restore will inherit the SnapLock Vault expiry time. Storage admin should manually cleanup the clones post the SnapLock expiry time.

.Steps

. In the left navigation pane, click *Resources*, and then select the appropriate plug-in from the list.
. In the Resources page, filter resources from the *View* drop-down list based on resource type.
+
The resources are displayed along with information such as type, host, associated resource groups and policies, and status.

. Select the resource or resource group.
+
You must select a resource if you select a resource group.
+
The resource or resource group topology page is displayed.

. From the Manage Copies view, select *Backups* either from the primary or secondary (mirrored or vaulted) storage systems.
. Select the data backup from the table, and then click image:../media/clone_icon.gif[clone icon].
. In the Location page, perform the following actions:
+
|===
| For this field...| Do this...

a|
Plug-in host
a|
Select the host on which the clone should be mounted and the plug-in is installed.
a|
Target Clone SID
a|
Enter the SAP HANA instance ID to clone from the existing backups.
a|
NFS Export IP Address
a|
Enter IP addresses or the host names on which the cloned volumes will be exported.
a|
iSCSI Initiator
a|
Enter iSCSI initiator name of the host to which the LUNs are exported.     This option is available only if you selected LUN resource type.
a|
Protocol
a|
Enter the LUN protocol.    This option is available only if you selected LUN resource type.
|===
If the resource selected is a LUN and you are cloning from a secondary backup, then the destination volumes are listed. A single source can have multiple destination volumes.
+
NOTE: Before cloning, you must ensure that the iSCSI initiator or the FCP is present and are configured and logged into alternate hosts.

. In the Scripts page, perform the following steps:
+
NOTE: The scripts are run on the plug-in host.

 .. Enter the commands for pre clone or post clone that should be run before or after the clone operation, respectively.
  *** Pre clone command: delete existing databases with the same name
  *** Post clone command: verify a database or start a database.
 .. Enter the mount command to mount a file system to a host.
+
Mount command for a volume or qtree on a Linux machine:
+
Example for NFS: `mount VSERVER_DATA_IP:%VOLUME_NAME_Clone /mnt`

. In the Notification page, from the *Email preference* drop-down list, select the scenarios in which you want to send the emails.
+
You must also specify the sender and receiver email addresses, and the subject of the email.

. Review the summary, and then click *Finish*.
. Monitor the operation progress by clicking *Monitor* > *Jobs*.

.Steps

. Initiate a connection session with the SnapCenter Server for a specified user by using the Open-SmConnection cmdlet.

. Retrieve the backups to perform the clone operation by using the Get-SmBackup cmdlet.
+
This example shows that two backups are available for cloning:

 C:\PS> Get-SmBackup

        --------                      ----------                    ----------                    ----------

. Initiate a clone operation from an existing backup and specify the NFS export IP addresses on which the cloned volumes are exported.
+
This example shows that the backup to be cloned has an NFSExportIPs address of 10.232.206.169:
+
----
New-SmClone -AppPluginCode hana -BackupName scsccore1_sccore_test_com_hana_H73_scsccore1_06-07-2017_02.54.29.3817 -Resources @{"Host"="scsccore1.sccore.test.com";"Uid"="H73"}  -CloneToInstance shivscc4.sccore.test.com -mountcommand 'mount 10.232.206.169:%hana73data_Clone /hana83data' -preclonecreatecommands '/home/scripts/scpre_clone.sh' -postclonecreatecommands '/home/scripts/scpost_clone.sh'
----
+
NOTE: If NFSExportIPs is not specified, the default is exported to the clone target host.

. Verify that the backups were cloned successfully by using the Get-SmCloneReport cmdlet to view the clone job details.
+
You can view details such as clone ID, start date and time, end date and time.
