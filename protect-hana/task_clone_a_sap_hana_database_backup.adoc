You can use SnapCenter to clone a backup. You can clone from primary or secondary backup.

*What you will need*

* You should have backed up the resources or resource group.
* You should ensure that the aggregates hosting the volumes should be in the assigned aggregates list of the storage virtual machine (SVM).
* You cannot clone file-based backups.
* The target clone server should have the same SAP HANA instance SID that is provided in the Target Clone SID field.

*About this task*
For information about clone split operation limitations, see http://docs.netapp.com/ontap-9/topic/com.netapp.doc.dot-cm-vsmg/home.html[ONTAP 9 Logical Storage Management Guide^].

*Steps*

. In the left navigation pane, click *Resources*, and then select the appropriate plug-in from the list.
. On the *Resources* page, filter resources from the *View* drop-down list based on resource type.
+
The resources are displayed along with information such as type, host, associated resource groups and policies, and status.

. Select the resource or resource group.
+
You must select a resource if you select a resource group.
+
The resource or resource group topology page is displayed.

. From the Manage Copies view, select *Backups* either from the primary or secondary (mirrored or vaulted) storage systems.
. Select the data backup from the table, and then click image:../media/clone_icon.gif[clone icon].

a|
Plug-in host

a|
Target Clone SID
a|
Enter the SAP HANA instance ID to clone from the existing backups.
a|
NFS Export IP Address
a|
Enter IP addresses or the host names on which the cloned volumes will be exported.
a|
iSCSI Initiator
a|
Enter iSCSI initiator name of the host to which the LUNs are exported.     This option is available only if you selected LUN resource type.
a|
Protocol
a|
Enter the LUN protocol.    This option is available only if you selected LUN resource type.
|===
If the resource selected is a LUN and you are cloning from a secondary backup, then the destination volumes are listed. A single source can have multiple destination volumes.
+
NOTE: Before cloning, you must ensure that the iSCSI initiator or the FCP is present and are configured and logged into alternate hosts.

. On the *Scripts* page, perform the following steps:
[NOTE]
The scripts are run on the plug-in host.

 .. Enter the commands for pre clone or post clone that should be run before or after the clone operation, respectively.
  *** Pre clone command: delete existing databases with the same name
  *** Post clone command: verify a database or start a database.
 .. Enter the mount command to mount a file system to a host.
+
Mount command for a volume or qtree on a Linux machine:
+
Example for NFS:
+
  mount VSERVER_DATA_IP:%{VOLUME_NAME_Clone} /mnt

. On the *Notification* page, from the *Email preference* drop-down list, select the scenarios in which you want to send the emails.
