Resources are SAP HANA databases and Non-data Volume on the Linux host that are managed by SnapCenter. After installing the SnapCenter Plug-in for SAP HANA Database plug-in, the SAP HANA databases on that Linux host are automatically discovered and displayed in the Resources page.

Automatic discovery is supported for the following SAP HANA resources:

* Single containers
+
After installing or upgrading the plug-in, the single container resources located on a centralized host plug-in will continue as manually added resources.
+
After installing or upgrading the plug-in, the SAP HANA databases are automatically discovered only on the SAP HANA Linux hosts, which are directly registered into SnapCenter.

* Multitenant database container (MDC)
+
After installing or upgrading the plug-in, the MDC resources located on a centralized host plug-in will continue as manually added resource.
+
You must continue to manually add the MDC resources on the centralized host plug-in after upgrading to SnapCenter 4.3.
+
For SAP HANA Linux hosts directly registered in SnapCenter, installing or upgrading the plug-in will trigger an automatic discovery for resources on the host. After upgrading the plug-in, for every MDC resource that was located on the plug-in host, another MDC resource will be automatically discovered with a different GUID format and registered in SnapCenter. The new resource will be in locked state.
+
For example, in SnapCenter 4.2, if E90 MDC resource was located on the plug-in host and registered manually, after upgrading to SnapCenter 4.3, another E90 MDC resource with a different GUID will be discovered and registered in SnapCenter.

Automatic discovery is not supported for the following configurations:

* RDM and VMDK layouts
+
NOTE: In case the above resources are discovered, the data protection operations are not supported on these resources.

* HANA multiple-host configuration
* Multiple instances on the same host
* Multitier scale out HANA System Replication
* Cascaded replication environment in System Replication mode
