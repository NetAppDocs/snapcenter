Backup type specifies the type of backup that you want to create. SnapCenter supports File-Based Backup and Snapshot copy-based backup types for SAP HANA databases.

== File-Based Backup

File-Based Backups verify the integrity of the database. You can schedule the file-based backup operation to occur at specific intervals. Only active tenants are backed up. You cannot restore and clone File-Based backups from SnapCenter.

== Snapshot copy based backup

Snapshot copy-based backups leverage NetApp Snapshot copy technology to create online, read-only copies of the volumes on which the SAP HANA databases reside.
