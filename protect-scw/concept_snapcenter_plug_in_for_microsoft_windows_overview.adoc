The SnapCenter Plug-in for Microsoft Windows is a host-side component of the NetApp SnapCenter Software that enables application-aware data protection management of Microsoft file system resources. In addition, it provides storage provisioning, Snapshot copy consistency, and space reclamation for Windows file systems. The Plug-in for Windows automates file system backup, restore, and cloning operations in your SnapCenter environment.

When the Plug-in for Windows is installed, you can use SnapCenter with NetApp SnapMirror technology to create mirror copies of backup sets on another volume and with NetApp SnapVault technology to perform disk-to-disk backup replication for archival or standards compliance.
