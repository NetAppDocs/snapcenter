If a resource is not in a resource group, you can back up the resource on demand from the Resources page.

*About this task*

If you want to back up a resource that has a SnapMirror relationship with secondary storage, the role assigned to the storage user should include the "`snapmirror all`" privilege. However, if you are using the "`vsadmin`" role, then the "`snapmirror all`" privilege is not required.

NOTE: When backing up a file system, SnapCenter does not back up LUNs that are mounted on a volume mount point (VMP) in the file system that is being backed up.

IMPORTANT: If you are working in a Windows file system context, do not back up database files. Doing so creates an inconsistent backup and a possible loss of data when restoring. To protect database files, you must use the appropriate SnapCenter plug-in for the database (for example, SnapCenter Plug-in for Microsoft SQL Server, SnapCenter Plug-in for Microsoft Exchange Server, or a custom plug-in for database files).

*Steps*

. In the left navigation pane, click *Resources*, and then select the appropriate plug-in from the list.
. In the Resources page, select the File System resource type, and then select the resource that you want to back up.
. If the File System - Protect wizard does not start automatically, click *Protect* to start the wizard.
+
Specify the protection settings, as described in the Creating resource groups tasks.

. Optional: In the Resource page of the wizard, enter a custom name format for the Snapshot copy.
+
For example, customtext_resourcegroup_policy_hostname or resourcegroup_hostname. By default, a timestamp is appended to the Snapshot copy name.

. In the Policies page, perform the following tasks:
 .. Select one or more policies from the drop-down list.
+
You can select any existing policy, and then click *Details* to determine whether you can use that policy.
+
If no existing policy meets your requirements, you can copy an existing policy and modify it or you can create a new policy by clicking image:../media/add_policy_from_resourcegroup.gif[] to start the policy wizard.
+
The selected policies are listed in the Policy column in the Configure schedules for selected policies section.

 .. In the Configure schedules for selected policies section, click image:../media/add_policy_from_resourcegroup.gif[] in the Configure Schedules column for the policy for which you want to configure the schedule.
 .. In the Add schedules for policy _policy_name_ dialog box, configure the schedule by specifying the start date, expiration date, and frequency, and then click *Finish*.
+
The configured schedules are listed in the Applied Schedules column in the Configure schedules for selected policies section.

. In the Backup page, perform the following steps:
 .. If you have applied multiple policies to the resource, from the Policy drop-down list, select the policy that you want to use for backup.
+
If the policy selected for the on-demand backup is associated with a backup schedule, the on-demand backups will be retained based on the retention settings specified for the schedule type.

 .. Click *Backup*.
