You can use SnapCenter to clone a Windows file system backup. If you want a copy of a single file that was mistakenly deleted or changed, then you can clone a backup and access that file in the clone.

*What you will need*

* You should have prepared for data protection by completing tasks such as adding hosts, identifying resources, and creating storage virtual machine (SVM) connections.
* You should have a backup of the file system.
* You should ensure that the aggregates hosting the volumes should be in the assigned aggregates list of the storage virtual machine (SVM).
* You cannot clone a resource group. You can only clone individual file system backups.
* If a backup resides on a virtual machine with a VMDK disk, SnapCenter cannot clone the backup to a physical server.
* If you clone a Windows cluster (for example, a shared LUN or a cluster shared volume (CSV) LUN), the clone is stored as a dedicated LUN on the host that you specify.
* For a cloning operation, the root directory of the volume mount point cannot be a shared directory.
* You cannot create a clone on a node that is not the home node for the aggregate.
* You cannot schedule recurring clone (clone lifecycle) operations for Windows file systems; you can only clone a backup on demand.
* If you move a LUN that contains a clone to a new volume, SnapCenter can no longer support the clone. For example, you cannot use SnapCenter to delete that clone.
* You cannot clone across environments. For example, cloning from a physical disk to a virtual disk or vice versa.

*Steps*

. In the left navigation pane, click *Resources*, and then select the appropriate plug-in from the list.
. In the Resources page, select *File Systems* from the list.
. Select the host.
+
The topology view is automatically displayed if the resource is protected.

. From the resources list, select the backup that you want to clone, and then click the clone icon.
. In the Options page, do the following:

| For this field...| Do this...

a|
Clone server
a|
Choose the host on which the clone should be created.
a|
"`Auto assign mount point`" or "`Auto assign volume mount point under path`"
a|
Choose whether to automatically assign a mount point or a volume mount point under a path.

Auto assign volume mount point under path: The mount point under a path enables you to provide a specific directory in which the mount points will be created. Before you choose this option, you must verify that the directory is empty. If there is a backup in the directory, the backup will be in an invalid state after the mount operation.

Archive location
a|
Choose an archive location if you are cloning a secondary backup.

. In the Script page, specify any prescripts or postscripts you want to execute.
. Review the summary, and then click *Finish*.
. Monitor the operation progress by clicking *Monitor* > *Jobs*.
