Single Mailbox Recovery (SMBR) software allows you to restore and recover mails or mailbox instead of the complete Exchange Database.

Restoring complete database just to recover a single mail will consume lot of time and resource. SMBR helps in quickly recovering the mails by creating clone copy of the Snapshot and then using Microsoft APIâ€™s to mount the mailbox in SMBR.
For information on how to use SMBR, see https://library.netapp.com/ecm/ecm_download_file/ECMLP2871407[SMBR Administration Guide^].
