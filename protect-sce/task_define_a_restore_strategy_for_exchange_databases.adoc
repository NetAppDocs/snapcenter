Defining a restoration strategy for Exchange Server enables you to restore your database successfully.

== Sources for a restore operation in Exchange Server
You can restore an Exchange Server database from a backup copy on primary storage.

You can restore databases from primary storage only.

== Types of restore operations supported for Exchange Server
You can use SnapCenter to perform different types of restore operations on Exchange resources.

* Restore up-to-the-minute
* Restore to a previous point in time

=== Restore up to the minute

In an up-to-the-minute restore operation, databases are recovered up to the point of failure. SnapCenter accomplishes this by performing the following sequence:

. Restores the databases from the full database backup that you select.
. Applies all the transaction logs that were backed up, as well as any new logs that were created since the most recent backup.
+
Transaction logs are moved ahead and applied to any selected databases.
+
Exchange creates a new log chain after a restore completes.
+
|===
*Best Practice:* It is recommended that you perform a new full and log backup after a restore completes.
|===
An up-to-the-minute restore operation requires a contiguous set of transaction logs.
+
After you perform an up-to-the-minute restore, the backup you used for the restore is available only for point-in-time restore operations.
+
If you do not need to retain up-to-the-minute restore capability for all backups, you can configure your system's transaction log backup retention through the backup policies.

=== Restore to a previous point in time

In a point-in-time restore operation, databases are restored only to a specific time from the past. A point-in-time restore operation occurs in the following restore situations:

* The database is restored to a given time in a backed-up transaction log.
* The database is restored, and only a subset of backed-up transaction logs are applied to it.
