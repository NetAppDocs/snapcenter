SnapCenter Plug-in for Microsoft Exchange Server does not provide backup verification; however, you can use the Eseutil tool provided with Exchange to verify Exchange databases and backups.

The Microsoft Exchange Eseutil tool is a command line utility that is included with your Exchange server. The utility enables you to perform consistency checks to verify the integrity of Exchange databases and backups.

|===
*Best Practice:* It is not necessary to perform consistency checks on databases that are part of a Database Availability Group (DAG) configuration with at least two replicas.
