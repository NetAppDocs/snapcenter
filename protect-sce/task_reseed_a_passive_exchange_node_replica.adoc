[.lead]
If you need to reseed a replica copy, for instance when a copy is corrupt, you can reseed to the latest backup using the reseed feature in SnapCenter.

* You must be using SnapCenter Server 4.1 or later, and Plug-in for Exchange 4.1 or later.
+
Reseeding a replica is not supported in SnapCenter versions earlier than 4.1.

* You must have created a backup of the database you want to reseed.

|===
*Best Practice:* To avoid lagging between nodes, we recommend that you either create a new backup before you perform a reseed operation, or choose the host with the latest backup.
|===

*Steps*

. In the left navigation pane, click *Resources*, and then select *Microsoft Exchange Server plug-in* from the list.
. In the Resources page, select the appropriate option from the View list:

. From the list of unhealthy databases copies in the Reseed wizard, select the one you want to reseed, and then click *Next*.

. In the Script page, enter the path and the arguments of the prescript or postscript that should be run before or after the reseed operation, respectively.
+
For example, you can run a script to update SNMP traps, automate alerts, send logs, and so on.

. In the Notification page, from the *Email preference* drop-down list, select the scenarios in which you want to send the emails.
+
You must also specify the sender and receiver email addresses, and the subject of the email.
