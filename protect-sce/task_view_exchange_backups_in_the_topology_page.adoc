When you are preparing to back up a resource, you might find it helpful to view a graphical representation of all backups on the primary and secondary storages.

.About this task

In the Topology page, you can see all of the backups that are available for the selected resource or resource group. You can view the details of those backups, and then select them to perform data protection operations.

You can review the following icon in the Manage Copies view to determine whether the backups are available on the primary or secondary storage (Mirror copies or Vault copies).

* image:../media/topology_primary_storage.gif[primary storage icon] displays the number of backups that are available on the primary storage.
* image:../media/topology_mirror_secondary_storage.gif[secondary storage Mirror icon] displays the number of backups that are mirrored on the secondary storage using SnapMirror technology.
* image:../media/topology_vault_secondary_storage.gif[secondary vault icon] displays the number of backups that are replicated on the secondary storage using SnapVault technology.
 ** The number of backups displayed includes the backups deleted from the secondary storage.
+
For example, if you created 6 backups using a policy to retain only 4 backups, the number of backups displayed is 6.
+
|===
*Best Practice:* To ensure the correct number of replicated backups is displayed, we recommend that you refresh the topology.

If you have secondary relationship as SnapMirror active sync (initially released as SnapMirror Business Continuity [SM-BC]), you can see following additional icons:

* image:../media/topology_replica_site_up.png[replica site up] The replica site is up.
* image:../media/topology_replica_site_down.png[replica site down]  The replica site is down.
* image:../media/topology_reestablished.png[relationship is reestablished] The secondary mirror or vault relationship has not been re-established.

.Steps

. In the left navigation pane, click *Resources*, and then select the appropriate plug-in from the list.
. In the Resources page, select the database, or the resource, or the resource group from the *View* drop-down list.
. Select the resource either from the database details view or from the resource group details view.
+
If the resource is protected, the Topology page of the selected resource is displayed.

. Review the Summary card section to see a summary of the number of backups available on the primary and secondary storage.
+
The Summary Card section displays the total number of backups and total number of log backups.
+
Clicking the *Refresh* button starts a query of the storage to display an accurate count.
+
If SnapLock enabled backup is taken, then clicking the *Refresh* button refreshes the primary and secondary SnapLock expiry time retrieved from ONTAP. A weekly schedule also refreshes the primary and secondary SnapLock expiry time retrieved from ONTAP.
+
When the application resource is spread across multiple volumes, the SnapLock expiry time for the backup will be the longest SnapLock expiry time that is set for a Snapshot in a volume. The longest SnapLock expiry time is retrieved from ONTAP.
+
For SnapMirror active sync, clicking the *Refresh* button refreshes the SnapCenter backup inventory by querying ONTAP for both primary and replica sites. A weekly schedule also performs this activity for all databases containing SnapMirror active sync relationship.
+
* For SnapMirror active sync and only for ONTAP 9.14.1, Async Mirror or Async MirrorVault relationships to the new primary destination should be manually configured after failover. From ONTAP 9.15.1 onwards Async Mirror or Async MirrorVault is auto configured to the new primary destination.after failover.

* After failover, a backup should be created for SnapCenter to be aware of the failover. You can click *Refresh* only after a backup has been created.

. In the Manage Copies view, click *Backups* from the primary or secondary storage to see details of a backup.
+
The details of the backups are displayed in a table format.

. Select the backup from the table, and then click the data protection icons to perform restore, rename, and delete operations.
+
NOTE: You cannot rename or delete backups that are on the secondary storage. Deleting Snapshots is handled by ONTAP retention settings.
