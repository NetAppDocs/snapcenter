You can use PowerShell cmdlets to restore an unhealthy replica by using either the most recent copy on the same host or the most recent copy from an alternate host.

The information regarding the parameters that can be used with the cmdlet and their descriptions can be obtained by running _Get-Help command_name_. Alternatively, you can also refer to the https://library.netapp.com/ecm/ecm_download_file/ECMLP2883300[SnapCenter Software Cmdlet Reference Guide^].
