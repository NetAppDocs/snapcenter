To use the restore functionality completely, you must upgrade both SnapCenter Server and SnapCenter Plug-in for Exchange database to 4.6. 

* The Exchange Server must be online and running before you can restore a database.
* The databases must exist on the Exchange Server.

NOTE: Restoring deleted databases is not supported.

* SnapCenter schedules for the database must be suspended.
* The SnapCenter Server and the SnapCenter Plug-in for Microsoft Exchange Server host must be connected to the primary and secondary storage that contains the backups you want to restore.
