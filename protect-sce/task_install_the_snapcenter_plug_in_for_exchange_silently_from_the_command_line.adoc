You should install Plug-in for Exchange from within the SnapCenter user interface. However, if you cannot for some reason, you can run the Plug-in for Exchange installation program unattended in silent mode from the Windows command line.

*What you will need*

* You must have backed up your Microsoft Exchange Server resources.
* You must have installed the SnapCenter plug-in packages.
* You must delete the earlier release of SnapCenter Plug-in for Microsoft SQL Server before installing.

*Steps*

. Validate whether _C:\temp_ folder exists on the plug-in host and the logged in user has full access to it.
. Download the SnapCenter Plug-in for Microsoft Windows from _C:\ProgramData\NetApp\SnapCenter\Package_ Repository.
+
This path is accessible from the host where the SnapCenter Server is installed.

. Copy the installation file to the host on which you want to install the plug-in.
. From a Windows command prompt on the local host, navigate to the directory to which you saved the plug-in installation files.
. Enter the following command to install replacing the variables with your data:
+
_snapcenter_windows_host_plugin.exe"/silent /debuglog"<Debug_Log_Path>" /log"<Log_Path>" BI_SNAPCENTER_PORT=<Num> SUITE_INSTALLDIR="<Install_Directory_Path>" BI_SERVICEACCOUNT=<domain\administrator> BI_SERVICEPWD=<password> ISFeatureInstall=HPPW,SCW,SCE_
+
For example:
+
_C:\ProgramData\NetApp\SnapCenter\Package Repository\snapcenter_windows_host_plugin.exe"/silent /debuglog"C:\HPPW_SCSQL_Install.log" /log"C:\temp" BI_SNAPCENTER_PORT=8145 SUITE_INSTALLDIR="C:\Program Files\NetApp\SnapCenter" BI_SERVICEACCOUNT=domain\administrator BI_SERVICEPWD=password ISFeatureInstall=HPPW,SCW,SCE_
+
NOTE: All the parameters passed during the installation of Plug-in for Exchange are case sensitive.

.. _/silent /debuglog"C:\Installdebug.log" /log"C:\temp" BI_SNAPCENTER_PORT=8145 SUITE_INSTALLDIR="C:\Program Files" BI_SERVICEACCOUNT=demo\administrator BI_SERVICEPWD=Netapp1! ISFeatureInstall=HPPW,SCW_
+
Enter the following values for the variables:
+
|===
| Variable| Value

a|
_/debuglog"<Debug_Log_Path>_
a|
Specify the name and location of the suite installer log file, as in the following example:

_Setup.exe /debuglog"C:\PathToLog\setupexe.log_
a|
BI_SNAPCENTER_PORT
a|
Specify the port on which SnapCenter communicates with SMCore.
a|
SUITE_INSTALLDIR
a|
Specify host plug-in package installation directory.
a|
BI_SERVICEACCOUNT
a|
Specify SnapCenter Plug-in for Microsoft Windows web service account.
a|
BI_SERVICEPWD
a|
Specify the password for SnapCenter Plug-in for Microsoft Windows web service account.
a|
ISFeatureInstall

|===

. Monitor the Windows task scheduler, the main installation log file _C:\Installdebug.log_, and the additional installation files in _C:\Temp_.
. Monitor the _%temp%_ directory to check if the _msiexe.exe_ installers are installing the software without errors.
+
NOTE: The installation of Plug-in for Exchange registers the plug-in on the host and not on the SnapCenter Server. You can register the plug-in on the SnapCenter Server by adding the host using the SnapCenter GUI or PowerShell cmdlet. After the host is added, the plug-in is automatically discovered.
