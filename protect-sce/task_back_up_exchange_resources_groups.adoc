A resource group is a collection of resources on a host or Exchange DAG, and the resource group can include either a whole DAG or individual databases. You can backup the resources groups from the Resources page.

*What you will need*

* You must have created a resource group with a policy attached.
* You must have assigned the aggregate that is being used by the backup operation to the storage virtual machine (SVM) used by the database.
* If you want to back up a resource that has a SnapMirror relationship with a secondary storage, the role assigned to the storage user should include the "`snapmirror all`" privilege. However, if you are using the "`vsadmin`" role, then the "`snapmirror all`" privilege is not required.
* If a resource group has multiple databases from different hosts, the backup operation on some of the hosts might start late because of network issues. You should configure the value of `MaxRetryForUninitializedHosts` in `web.config` by using the `Set-SmConfigSettings` PowerShell cmdlet.
* In a resource group, if you include a Database or Database Availability Group which has active/passive database copy on a NetApp and non-NetApp storage, and you have selected *Back up active copies* or *Back up copies on servers to be selected during backup job creation time* option in the policy, then the backup jobs will go into warning state.
+
The backup will succeed for active/passive database copy on NetApp storage and backup will fail for active/passive database copy on non-NetApp storage.

*About this task*

You can back up a resource group on demand from the Resources page. If a resource group has a policy attached and a schedule configured, then backups occur automatically according to the schedule.

*Steps*

. In the left navigation pane, click *Resources*, and then select the *Microsoft Exchange Server plug-in* from the list.
. In the Resources page, select *Resource Group* from the *View* list.
+
You can search the resource group either by entering the resource group name in the search box or by clicking *image:../media/filter_icon.gif[]*, and then selecting the tag. You can then click *image:../media/filter_icon.gif[]* to close the filter pane.

. In the Resource Groups page, select the resource group that you want to back up, and then click *Back up Now*.
. In the Backup page, perform the following steps:
 .. If you have associated multiple policies with the resource group, from the *Policy* drop-down list, select the policy that you want to use for backup.
+
If the policy selected for the on-demand backup is associated with a backup schedule, the on-demand backups will be retained based on the retention settings specified for the schedule type.

 .. Click *Backup*.
. Monitor the backup's progress by double-clicking the job in the Activity pane at the bottom of the page to display the Job Details page.
