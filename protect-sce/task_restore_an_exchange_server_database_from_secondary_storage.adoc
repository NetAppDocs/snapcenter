You can restore a backed up Exchange Server database from secondary storage (mirror or vault).

You must have replicated the Snapshots from primary storage to a secondary storage.

* For ONTAP 9.12.1 and below version, the clones created from the SnapLock Vault Snapshots as part of restore will inherit the SnapLock Vault expiry time. Storage admin should manually cleanup the clones post the SnapLock expiry time.

* For SnapMirror active sync restore operation, you must select the backup from the primary location.

.Steps

. In the left navigation pane, click *Resources*, and then select *Microsoft Exchange Server plug-in* from the list.
. In the Resources page, select *Database* or *Resource Group* from the *View* drop-down list.
. Select the database or the resource group.
+
The database or resource group topology page is displayed.

. In the Manage Copies section, select *Backups* from the secondary storage system (mirror or vault).
. Select the backup from the list, and then click image:../media/restore_icon.gif[restore icon].
. In the Location page, choose the destination volume for restoring the selected resource.
. Complete the Restore wizard, review the summary, and then click *Finish*.
