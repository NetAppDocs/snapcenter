SnapCenter supports data protection of SQL instances on SMB shares on Azure NetApp Files. The standalone and availability group (AG) configurations are supported.

You must use the SnapCenter Add Host page to add hosts, and then install the plug-ins package. The plug-ins are automatically installed on the remote hosts.

.Before you begin

* You must be a user that is assigned to a role that has the plug-in install and uninstall permissions, such as the SnapCenter Admin role.
* When installing a plug-in on a Windows host, if you specify a credential that is not built-in, or if the user belongs to a local workgroup user, you must disable UAC on the host.

.Steps

. In the left navigation pane, select *Hosts*.
. Verify that the *Managed Hosts* tab is selected at the top.
. Select *Add*.
. In the Hosts page do the following:
.. In the Host Type field, select the host type.
.. In the Host name field, enter the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) or the IP address of the host.
.. In the Credentials field, enter the credential that you created.
. In the *Select Plug-ins to Install* section, select the plug-ins to install.
. (Optional) Click *More Options* and specify the details.
. Select *Submit*.
. Select *Configure log directory* and in the Configure host log directory page, enter the SMB path of the host log directory, and click *Save*.
. Click *Submit* and monitor the installation progress.
