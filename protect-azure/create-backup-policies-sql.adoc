. In the Settings page, click *Policies*.
. Click *New*.
. In the Name page, enter the policy name and description.
. In the Policy type page, perform the following steps:
.. Select *Azure NetApp Files* as the storage type.
.. Select the backup type.
... Select *Full Backup and Log Backup* if you want to back up database files and transaction logs.
... Select *Full Backup* if you want to back up only the database files.
... Select *Log Backup* if you want to back up only the transaction logs.
... Select *Copy Only Backup* if you want to back up your resources by using another application.
.. In the Availability Group Settings section, perform the following actions:
