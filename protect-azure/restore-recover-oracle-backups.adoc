In the event of data loss, you can use SnapCenter to restore data from one or more backups to your active file system and then recover the database. 

.Steps

. In the left navigation pane, click *Resources*, and then select the appropriate plug-in from the list.
. In the Resources page, select either *Database* or *Resource Group* from the View list.
. Select the database or the resource group from the list.
. From the Manage Copies view, select *Backups* from the primary storage system.
. Select the backup from the table, and then click *image:../media/restore_icon.gif[restore icon]*.
. In the Restore Scope page, perform the following tasks:
.. Select RAC if you have selected a backup of a database in RAC environment.
.. Perform the following actions:
... Select *All Datafiles* if you want to restore only the database files.
... Select *Tablespaces* if you want to restore only the tablespaces.
... Select *Redo log files* if you want to restore the redo log files of the Data Guard standby or Active Data Guard standby databases.
... Select *Pluggable databases* and specify the PDBs you want to restore.
... Select *Pluggable database (PDB) tablespaces*, and then specify the PDB and the tablespaces of that PDB that you want to restore.
... Select *Restore the database to the same host where the backup was created* if you want to restore the database to the same SQL server where the backups are taken.
... Select *Restore the database to an alternate host* if you want the database to be restored to a different SQL server in the same or different host where backups are taken.
... Select *Change database state if needed for restore and recovery* to change the state of the database to the state required to perform restore and recovery operations.
... Select *Force in place restore* if you want to perform in-place restore in the scenarios where new datafiles are added after backup or when LUNs are added, deleted, or re-created to an LVM disk group.
. In the Recovery Scope page, select one of the following options:
.. Select *All Logs* if you want to recover to the last transaction.
.. Select *Until SCN (System Change Number)* if you want to recover to a specific SCN.
.. Select *Date and Time* if you want to recover to a specific date and time.

. Review the summary, and then click *Finish*.
. Monitor the operation progress by clicking *Monitor* > *Jobs*.


== Restore and recover tablespaces using point-in-time recovery

You can restore a subset of tablespaces that have been corrupted or dropped without impacting the other tablespaces in the database. SnapCenter uses RMAN to perform point-in-time recovery (PITR) of the tablespaces.

.Steps

. In the left navigation pane, click *Resources*, and then select the appropriate plug-in from the list.
. In the Resources page, select either *Database* or *Resource Group* from the View list.
. Select the database of type single instance (multitenant).
. From the Manage Copies view, select *Backups* from the storage system.
+
If the backup is not cataloged, you should select the backup and click *Catalog*.
. Select the catalogued backup, and then click *image:../media/restore_icon.gif[restore icon]*.
. In the Restore Scope page, perform the following tasks:
.. Select *RAC* if you have selected a backup of a database in RAC environment.
.. Select *Tablespaces* if you want to restore only the tablespaces.
.. Select *Change database state if needed for restore and recovery* to change the state of the database to the state required to perform restore and recovery operations.
. In the Recovery Scope page, select one of the following options:
.. Select *Until SCN (System Change Number)* if you want to recover to a specific SCN.
.. Select *Date and Time* if you want to recover to a specific date and time.
. In the Pre-Ops and Post Ops page, specify the required details.
. In the Notification page, from the *Email preference* drop-down list, select the scenarios in which you want to send the emails.
. Review the summary, and then click *Finish*.
. Monitor the restore process by using the *Monitor* > *Jobs* page.

== Restore and recover pluggable database using point-in-time recovery

You can restore and recover a pluggable database (PDB) that has been corrupted or dropped without impacting the other PDBs in the container database (CDB). SnapCenter uses RMAN to perform point-in-time recovery (PITR) of the PDB.

.Steps

. In the left navigation pane, click *Resources*, and then select the appropriate plug-in from the list.
. In the Resources page, select either *Database* or *Resource Group* from the View list.
. Select the database of type single instance (multitenant).
. From the Manage Copies view, select *Backups* from the storage system.
+
If the backup is not cataloged, you should select the backup and click *Catalog*.
. Select the catalogued backup, and then click *image:../media/restore_icon.gif[restore icon]*.
. In the Restore Scope page, perform the following tasks:
.. Select *RAC* if you have selected a backup of a database in RAC environment.
.. Depending on whether you want to restore the PDB or tablespaces in a PDB, perform one of the actions:
*** Select *Pluggable databases (PDBs)* if you want to restore a PDB.
*** Select *Pluggable database (PDB) tablespaces* if you want to restore tablespaces in a PDB.
. In the Recovery Scope page, select one of the following options:
.. Select *Until SCN (System Change Number)* if you want to recover to a specific SCN.
.. Select *Date and Time* if you want to recover to a specific date and time.
. In the Pre-Ops and Post Ops page, specify the required details.
