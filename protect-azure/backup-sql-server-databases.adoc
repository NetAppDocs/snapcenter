.Before you begin

You should create a load balancer, if the Azure Windows Failover Cluster does not have a cluster IP assigned or if it is not reachable from SnapCenter. The load balancer's IP should be configured and reachable from the SnapCenter Server.

. In the Resource page, select *Database*, *Instance*, or *Availability Group* from the View drop-down list.
. In the Resource page, select *Use custom name format for Snapshot copy*, and then enter a custom name format that you want to use for the Snapshot name.
. In the Policies page, perform the following steps:
.. Select one or more policies from the drop-down list.
.. Select *image:../media/add_policy_from_resourcegroup.gif[]* in the Configure Schedules column for the policy for which you want to configure a schedule.
