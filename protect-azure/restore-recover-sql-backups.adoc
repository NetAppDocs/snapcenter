You can use SnapCenter to restore SQL Server databases. Restoring a database is a multiphase process that copies all the data and log pages from a specified SQL Server backup to a specified database.

.Before you begin

* Configure the target instance with an active directory user who belongs to the SMB ADactive directory domain and has permissions to set the file permissions appropriately. 
* Configure the credentials at SnapCenter instance level.
* If the SQL database exists on CIFS share, then the RunAS account and SQL service account (domain account) of the plug-in host need to be part of the `BUILTIN\Administrators` group of the CIFS server in ONTAP.
* SMB configurations do not support SQL authentication for the target instance. Configure the target instance in SnapCenter with an active directory user who has the required permissions.
* If the SnapCenter Plug-in service account is not an active directory user, ensure that a user with full control over the source volumes is available when restoring to an alternate host.

.Steps

. In the left navigation pane, click *Resources*, and then select the appropriate plug-in from the list.
. In the Resources page, select either *Database* or *Resource Group* from the View list.
. Select the database or the resource group from the list.
. From the Manage Copies view, select *Backups* from storage system.
. Select the backup from the table, and then click the image:../media/restore_icon.gif[restore icon] icon.
. In the Restore Scope page, select one of the following options:
.. Select *Restore the database to the same host where the backup was created* to restore the database to the same SQL server.
.. Select *Restore the database to an alternate host* if you want to restore the database to a different SQL server in the same or another host where backups are taken.
. In the Recovery Scope page, select one of the following options:
.. Select *None* when you need to restore only the full backup without any logs.
.. Select *All log backups* up-to-the-minute backup restore operation to restore all the available log backups after the full backup.
.. Select *By log backups* to perform a point-in-time restore operation, which restores the database based on backup logs until the backup log with the selected date.
.. Select *By specific date until* to specify the date and time after which transaction logs are not applied to the restored database.
.. If you have selected *All log backups*, *By log backups*, or *By specific date until* and the logs are located at a custom location, select *Use custom log directory*, and then specify the log location.
. In the Pre-Ops and Post Ops page, specify the required details.
. In the Notification page, from the *Email preference* drop-down list, select the scenarios in which you want to send the emails.
. Review the summary, and then click *Finish*.
. Monitor the restore process by using the *Monitor* > *Jobs* page.
