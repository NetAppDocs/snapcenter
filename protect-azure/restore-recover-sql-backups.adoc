You can use SnapCenter to restore backed-up SQL Server databases. Database restoration is a multiphase process that copies all the data and log pages from a specified SQL Server backup to a specified database.

.About this task

You should ensure that the target instance for restore is configured with an active directory user who belongs to the SMB ADactive directory domain and has permissions to set the file permissions appropriately. You should configure the credentials in SnapCenter at instance level.

The SQL authentication for target instance will not be supported for SMB configurations. The target instance should be configured in SnapCenter with the active directory user having the required permissions.

If the SnapCenter Plug-in services service account is not an active directory user then while performing restore to alternate host, the user who have the full control over the source volumes is required so that it can be impersonated and perform the required operation.

.Steps

. In the left navigation pane, click *Resources*, and then select the appropriate plug-in from the list.
. In the Resources page, select either *Database* or *Resource Group* from the View list.
. Select the database or the resource group from the list.
. From the Manage Copies view, select *Backups* from storage system.
. Select the backup from the table, and then click the image:../media/restore_icon.gif[restore icon] icon.
. In the Restore Scope page, select one of the following options:
.. Select *Restore the database to the same host where the backup was created* if you want to restore the database to the same SQL server where the backups are taken.
.. Select *Restore the database to an alternate host* if you want the database to be restored to a different SQL server in the same or different host where backups are taken.
. In the Recovery Scope page, select one of the following options:
.. Select *None* when you need to restore only the full backup without any logs.
.. Select *All log backups* up-to-the-minute backup restore operation to restore all the available log backups after the full backup.
.. Select *By log backups* to perform a point-in-time restore operation, which restores the database based on backup logs until the backup log with the selected date.
.. Select *By specific date until* to specify the date and time after which transaction logs are not applied to the restored database.
.. If you have selected *All log backups*, *By log backups*, or *By specific date until* and the logs are located at a custom location, select *Use custom log directory*, and then specify the log location.
. In the Pre-Ops and Post Ops page, specify the required details.
. In the Notification page, from the *Email preference* drop-down list, select the scenarios in which you want to send the emails.
