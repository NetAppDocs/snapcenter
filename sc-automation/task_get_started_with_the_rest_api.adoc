You can quickly get started using the SnapCenter REST API. Accessing the API provides some perspective before you begin using it with the more complex workflow processes on a live setup.

== Hello World

You can run a simple command on your system to get started using the SnapCenter REST API and confirm its availability.

*What you will need*

* Ensure that the Curl utility is available on your system.
* IP address or host name of the SnapCenter Server
* User name and password for an account with authority to access the SnapCenter REST API.

NOTE: If your credentials include special characters, you need to format them in a way that is acceptable to Curl based on the shell you are using. For example, you can insert a backslash before each special character or wrap the entire `username:password` string in single quotes.

*Step*

At the command line interface, run the following to retrieve the plug-in information:

`curl -X GET -u username:password -k "https://<ip_address>/api/hosts?fields=IncludePluginInfo"`

Example:

`curl -X GET -u admin:password -k "'https://10.225.87.97/api/hosts?fields=IncludePluginInfo"`
