REST APIs can be used to perform several SnapCenter management operations. REST APIs are exposed through the Swagger web page.

You can access the Swagger web page available at _\https://<SnapCenter_IP_address_or_name>:<SnapCenter_port>/swagger/_ to display the REST API documentation, as well as to manually issue an API call.

The plug-ins that support REST APIs are:

* Plug-in for Microsoft SQL Server
* Plug-in for SAP HANA Database
* Custom Plug-ins
* Plug-in for Oracle Database
