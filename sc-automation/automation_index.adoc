Describes how to use REST APIs to perform several SnapCenter management operations. REST APIs are exposed through the Swagger web page.

You can access the Swagger web page available at \https://<SnapCenter_IP_address_or_name>:<SnapCenter_port>/swagger/ to display the REST API documentation, as well as to manually issue an API call.

The plug-ins that support REST APIs are:

* Plug-in for SQL Server
* Plug-in for SAP HANA Database
* Custom Plug-ins

If you encounter unexpected behavior when executing SnapCenter REST APIs, you can use the log files to identify the cause and resolve the problem.

You can download the log files from the SnapCenter user interface by clicking *Monitor* > *Logs* > *Download*.
