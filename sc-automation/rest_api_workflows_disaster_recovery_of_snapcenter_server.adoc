SnapCenter disaster recovery (DR) functionality uses REST APIs to backup SnapCenter Server. Using REST APIs, you can perform the following operations on the REST APIs Swagger page. For information to access the Swagger page, see link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/snapcenter/sc-automation/task_how%20to_access_rest_apis_using_the_swagger_api_web_page.html[How to access REST APIs using the swagger API web page].

*What you will need*

*	You should log in as the SnapCenter Admin user.
* The SnapCenter Server should be up and running to run DR restore API.


*About this task*

Fetch existing SnapCenter Server DR backups

[NOTE]

You should provide the target path where the DR backups are stored.

`/4.5/disasterrecovery/server/backup?targetpath={path}`

Create a new Server DR backup.

Restores a SnapCenter Server from a specified Server DR backup.

*Prerequisites*

* The alternate server host name should be same as the primary server, but the IP address can be different.
* Server version should be the same as the primary server.
* Ensure the DR backup files are copied to the new SnapCenter server using the following command:
+
`xcopy <Ssource_Path> \\<Destination_Server_IP>\<Folder_Path> /O /X /E /H /K  {ex : xcopy C:\DRBackup \\10.225.81.114\c$\DRBackup /O /X /E /H /K}`

If the plug-in is not able to resolve the server hostname, log into each of the plug-in host and add the etc/host entry for the new IP in the format:
`<New IP>	SC_Server_Name`

For example, 10.225.81.35	SCServer1

The server etc/host file will not be restored. You can restore it manually from the DR backup folder.
