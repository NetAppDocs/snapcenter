[.lead]
You can detach policies from a resource or resource group, modify, delete, view, and copy.

== Modify policies
You can modify the replication options, Snapshot copy retention settings, error retry count, or scripts information while a policy is attached to a resource or resource group. You can modify the schedule type (frequency) only after you detach a policy.

*About this task*

Modifying the schedule type in a policy requires additional steps because the SnapCenter Server registers the schedule type only at the time the policy is attached to a resource or resource group.

|===
| If you want to...| Then...

a|
Add an additional schedule type
a|
Create a new policy and attach it to the necessary resources or resource groups.

For example, if a resource group policy specifies only hourly backups and you want to add daily backups also, you can create a policy with a daily schedule type and add it to the resource group. The resource group would then have two policies: hourly and daily.

a|
Remove or change a schedule type
a|
Perform the following:

. Detach the policy from every resource and resource group that uses that policy.
. Modify the schedule type.
. Attach the policy again to all the resources and resource groups.

For example, if a policy specifies hourly backups and you want to change that to daily backups, you must detach the policy first.

*Steps*

. In the left navigation pane, click *Settings*.
. In the Settings page, click *Policies*.
. Select the policy, and then click *Modify*.
. Modify the information, and then click *Finish*.

== Detach policies

You can detach policies from a resource or resource group any time that you no longer want those policies to govern data protection for the resources. You must detach a policy before you can delete it or before you modify the schedule type.

*Steps*

. In the left navigation pane, click *Resources*, and then select the appropriate plug-in from the list.
. In the Resources page, select *Resource Group* from the *View* list.
. Select the resource group, and then click *Modify Resource Group*.
. In the Policies page of the Modify Resource Group wizard, from the drop-down list, clear the check mark next to the policies you want to detach.
. Make any additional modifications to the resource group in the rest of the wizard, and then click *Finish*.

== Delete policies

If you no longer require policies, you might want to delete them.

*What you will need*

You should detach the policy from resource or resource groups if the policy is associated with any resource or resource groups.

*Steps*

. In the left navigation pane, click *Settings*.
. In the Settings page, click *Policies*.
. Select the policy, and then click *Delete*.
. Click *Yes*.
