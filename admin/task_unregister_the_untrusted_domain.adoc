You can unregister an untrusted Active Directory domain if you do not want to use the assets that are associated with that domain.

You must have removed the hosts, users, groups, and credentials that are associated with the untrusted domain.

* After the domain is unregistered from SnapCenter Server, users of that domain cannot access SnapCenter Server.
* If there are associated assets (hosts, users, and groups), after unregistering the domain, the assets will be non-operational.
* To unregister an untrusted domain, you can use either the SnapCenter user interface or PowerShell cmdlets.

. In the left navigation pane, click *Settings*.
. In the Settings page, click *Global Settings*.
. In the Global Settings page, click *Domain Settings*.
. From the list of domains, select the domain that you want to unregister.
. Click image:../media/delete_icon.gif[], and then click *OK*.
