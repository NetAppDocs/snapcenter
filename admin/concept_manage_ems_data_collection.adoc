You can schedule and manage Event Management System (EMS) data collection using PowerShell cmdlets. EMS data collection involves gathering details about the SnapCenter Server, the installed SnapCenter plug-in packages, the hosts, and similar information, and then sending it to a specified ONTAP storage virtual machine (SVM).

NOTE: System CPU utilization is high when data-collection task is in progress. CPU utilization remains high as long as the operation is progress irrespective of the data size.
