When you want to prevent the host from running any SnapCenter scheduled jobs, you can place your host in maintenance mode. You must do this before you upgrade the plug-ins. You might want to do this if you are performing maintenance tasks on hosts.

You cannot suspend the schedules on a host that is down because SnapCenter cannot communicate with that host.

. In the left navigation pane, click *Hosts*.
. In the Hosts page, click *Managed Hosts*.
. In the Managed Hosts page, select the host that you want to suspend.
. Click the image:../media/more_icon.gif[] icon, and then click *Suspend Schedule* to place the host for this plug-in in maintenance mode.
+
You can suspend the schedule of multiple hosts simultaneously.
+
NOTE: You do not have to stop the plug-in service first. The plug-in service can be in a running or stopped state.
+
After you suspend the schedules on the host, the Managed Hosts page shows "`Suspended`" in the Overall status field for the host.

After you complete host maintenance, bring the host out of maintenance mode by clicking *Activate Schedule*.

You can activate the schedule of multiple hosts simultaneously.
