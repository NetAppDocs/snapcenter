In addition to managing hosts in Active Directory (AD) trusted domains, SnapCenter also manages hosts in multiple AD untrusted domains. The untrusted AD domains must be registered with the SnapCenter Server. SnapCenter supports users and groups of multiple untrusted AD domains.

You can install the SnapCenter Server on a machine that is in either a domain or a workgroup. To install the SnapCenter Server, you should specify the domain credentials if the machine is in a domain or the local administrator credentials if the machine is in a workgroup.

Active Directory (AD) groups that belong to domains not registered with the SnapCenter Server are not supported. Although you can create SnapCenter roles with these AD groups, logging in to SnapCenter Server fails with the following error message: The user you are trying to login does not belong to any roles. Please contact your administrator.

== Modify untrusted domains

You can modify an untrusted domain when you want to update the domain controller IP addresses or the fully qualified domain name (FQDN).

== Unregister untrusted Active Directory domains

You can unregister an untrusted Active Directory domain if you do not want to use the assets that are associated with that domain.

*What you will need*

You should have removed the hosts, users, groups, and credentials that are associated with the untrusted domain.

*About this task*

* After the domain is unregistered from SnapCenter Server, users of that domain cannot access SnapCenter Server.
* If there are associated assets (hosts, users, and groups), after unregistering the domain, the assets will be non-operational.
