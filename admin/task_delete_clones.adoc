You can delete clones if you find them no longer necessary.

A clone that has been cloned again cannot be deleted. For example, if the production database db1 is cloned to db1_clone1 and subsequently cloned to db1_clone2, and you decide that you want to delete db1_clone1, you must first delete db1_clone2, and then delete db1_clone1

. In the left navigation pane, click *Resources*, and then select the appropriate plug-in from the list.
. In the Resources page, either select the resource or resource group from the *View* drop-down list.
. Select the resource or resource group from the list.
+
The resource or the resource group topology page is displayed.

. From the Manage Copies view, select *Clones* either from the primary or secondary (mirrored or replicated) storage systems.
. Select the clone, and then click image:../media/delete_icon.gif[].

If you are deleting SAP HANA database clones, in the Delete Clone page, perform the following actions:

 .. In the *Pre clone delete* field, enter the commands that should be run before deleting the clone.
 .. In the *Unmount* field, enter the command to unmount the clone before deleting the clone.

. Click *OK*.

After deleting the clone, sometimes the file systems are not deleted. You must increase the value of the CLONE_DELETE_DELAY parameter by running the following command:``./sccli Set-SmConfigSettings``

NOTE: The CLONE_DELETE_DELAY parameter specifies the number of seconds to wait after completing the deletion of application clone and before starting the deletion of file system.

After modifying the value of the parameter, restart the SnapCenter Plug-in Loader (SPL) service.
