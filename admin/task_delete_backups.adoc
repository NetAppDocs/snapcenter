You can delete backups if you no longer require the backup for other data protection operations.

You must have deleted the associated clones before deleting a backup.

If a backup is associated with a cloned resource, you cannot delete the backup.

. In the left navigation pane, click *Resources*, and then select the appropriate plug-in from the list.
. In the Resources page either select the resource or resource group from the *View* drop-down list.
. Select the resource or resource group from the list.
+
The resource or resource group topology page is displayed.

. From the Manage Copies view, select *Backups* from the primary storage systems.
+
You cannot delete the backups that are on the secondary storage system.

. Select the backup, and then click image:../media/delete_icon.gif[].
+
If you are deleting a SAP HANA database backup, the associated SAP HANA catalogs of the backup are also deleted.
+
NOTE: If the last remaining backup is deleted, the associated HANA catalog entries cannot be deleted.

. Click *OK*.
+
NOTE: If you have some stale database backups in SnapCenter which do not have corresponding backups on the storage system, you must use remove-smbackup command to clean up these stale backup entries. If the stale backups were cataloged, they will be uncataloged from the recovery catalog database.
