[.lead]

The SnapCenter Server enables you to deploy and manage your applications as plug-ins to SnapCenter.
Applications of your choice can be plugged into the SnapCenter Server for data protection and
management capabilities.

SnapCenter enables you to develop custom plug-ins using different programming languages. You can
develop a custom plug-in using Perl, Java, BATCH, or other Scripting languages.

To use custom plug-ins in SnapCenter, you must perform the following tasks:

* Create a plug-in for your application using the instructions in this guide
* Create a description file
* Export the custom plug-in to install it on the SnapCenter host
* Upload the plug-in zip file into SnapCenter Server

== Generic plug-in handling in all API calls

[.lead]
For every API call, use the following information:

* Plug-in parameters
* Exit codes
* Log error messages
* Data consistency

=== Use Plug-in parameters

A set of parameters are passed to the plug-in as part of every API call made. The following table lists the specific information for the parameters.

|===
| Parameter| Purpose

a|
ACTION
a|
Determines the workflow name. For example, discover, backup, fileOrVolRestore or
cloneVolAndLun
a|
RESOURCES
a|
Lists resources to be protected. A resource is identified by UID and Type. The list is presented to the plug-in in the following format:

“<UID>,<TYPE>;<UID>,<TYPE>”. For example,
“Instance1,Instance;Instance2\\DB1,Database”
a|
APP_NAME
a|
Determines which plug-in is being used. For example, DB2, MYSQL. SnapCenter Server has built-in support for the listed applications. This parameter is case sensitive.
a|
APP_IGNORE_ERROR
a|
(Y or N) This causes SnapCenter to exit or not exit when an application error is encountered. This is useful when you are backing up multiple databases and do not want a single failure to
stop the backup operation.
a|
<RESOURCE_NAME>__APP_INSTANCE_USERNAME
a|
SnapCenter credential is set for the resource.
a|
<RESOURCE_NAME>_APP_INSTANCE_PASSWORD
a|
SnapCenter credential is set for the resource.
a|
<RESOURCE_NAME>_<CUSTOM_PARAM>
a|
Every Resource level custom key value is
available to plug-ins prefixed with
“<RESOURCE_NAME>_”. For example, if a
custom key is “MASTER_SLAVE” for a resource
named “MySQLDB”, then it will be available as
MySQLDB_MASTER_SLAVE
a|
|===

=== Use exit codes

The plug-in returns the status of the operation back to the host by means of exit codes. Each
code has a specific meaning and the plug-in uses the right exit code to indicate the same.

The following table depicts error codes and their meaning.

|===
| Exit code | Purpose

a|
0
a|
Successful operation.
a|
99
a|
Requested operation is not supported or implemented.
a|
100
a|
Failed operation, skip unquiesce, and exit. Unquiesce is by default.
a|
101
a|
Failed operation, continue with backup operation.
a|
other
a|
Failed operation, run unquiesce, and exit.
|===


=== Log error messages

The error messages are passed from the plug-in to the SnapCenter Server. The message
includes the message, log level, and time stamp.

The following table lists levels and their purposes.

|===
| Parameter| Purpose

a|
INFO
a|
informational message
a|
WARN
a|
warning message
a|
ERROR
a|
error message
a|
DEBUG
a|
debug message
a|
TRACE
a|
trace message
a|
|===

=== Preserve data consistency

Custom plug-ins preserve data between operations of the same workflow execution. For
example, a plug-in can store data at the end of quiesce, which can be used during unquiesce
operation.

The data to be preserved is set as part of result object by plug-in. It follows a specific format
and is described in detail under each style of plug-in development.
