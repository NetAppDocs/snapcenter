If an individual custom plug-in resource is not part of any resource group, you can back up the resource from the Resources page. You can back up the resource on demand, or, if the resource has a policy attached and a schedule configured, then backups occur automatically according to the schedule.

*What you will need*

* You must have created a backup policy.
* If you want to back up a resource that has a SnapMirror relationship with a secondary storage, the ONTAP role assigned to the storage user should include the "`snapmirror all`" privilege. However, if you are using the "`vsadmin`" role, then the "`snapmirror all`" privilege is not required.

*Steps*

. In the Resources page, filter resources from the *View* drop-down list based on resource type.

. In the Resource page, if you want to use a custom name, select the *Use custom name format for Snapshot copy* check box , and then enter a custom name format for the Snapshot copy name.
