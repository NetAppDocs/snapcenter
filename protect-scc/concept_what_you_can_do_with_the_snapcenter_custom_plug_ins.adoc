*Storage plug-in*

You can use the storage plug-in for data protection operations.

* Take consistency group Snapshot copies of the storage volumes across ONTAP clusters.
* Backup custom applications using the built in pre and post scripting framework
+
You can backup ONTAP volume, LUN, or a Qtree.
* Update Snapshot copies taken on the primary to an ONTAP secondary, leveraging the existing replication relationship (SnapVault/SnapMirror/unified replication) using SnapCenter policy
+
ONTAP primary and secondary can be ONTAP FAS, AFF, Select, or Cloud ONTAP.
* Recover complete ONTAP volume, LUN, or files.
+
You should provide the respective file path manually as the browse or indexing features are not built into the product.

Qtree or directory restore is not supported but you can clone and export only the Qtree if the backup scope is defined at a Qtree level.
