[.lead]
You can use SnapCenter to restore resources. The capabilities of the restore operations depends upon the plug-in that you use.

.Before you begin

* You must have backed up the resource or resource groups.
* The SnapCenter administrator must have assigned you the storage virtual machines (SVMs) for both the source volumes and destination volumes if you are replicating Snapshots to a mirror or vault.
* You must have cancelled any backup operation that is currently in progress for the resource or resource group you want to restore.

.About this task

* The default restore operation only restores storage objects. Restore operations at the application level can only be performed if the custom plug-in provides that capability.
* For ONTAP 9.12.1 and below version, the clones created from the SnapLock Vault Snapshots as part of restore will inherit the SnapLock Vault expiry time. Storage admin should manually cleanup the clones post the SnapLock expiry time.

.SnapCenter UI

.Steps

. In the left navigation pane, click *Resources*, and then select the appropriate plug-in from the list.
. In the Resources page, filter resources from the *View* drop-down list based on resource type.
+
The resources are displayed along with information such as type, host or cluster name, associated resource groups and policies, and status.
+
NOTE: Although a backup might be for a resource group, when you restore, you must select the individual resources you want to restore.
+
If the resource is not protected, _Not protected_ is displayed in the *Overall Status* column.
+
The status _Not protected_ in the *Overall Status* column can mean either that the resource is not protected, or that the resource was backed up by a different user.

. Select the resource or select a resource group and then select a resource in that group.
+
The resource topology page is displayed.

. From the *Manage Copies* view, select *Backups* either from the primary or secondary (mirrored or vaulted) storage systems.
. In the Primary backup(s) table, select the backup that you want to restore from, and then click image:../media/restore_icon.gif[restore icon].
+
image::../media/restoring_resource.gif[restoring resources]

. In the Restore Scope page, select either *Complete Resource* or *File Level*.
 .. If you selected *Complete Resource*, the resource backup is restored.
+
If the resource contains volumes or qtrees as Storage Footprint, then newer Snapshots on such volumes or qtrees are deleted and cannot be recovered. Also, if any other resource is hosted on same volumes or qtrees, then that resource is also deleted.

 .. If you selected *File Level*, then you can either select *All*, or select volumes or qtrees, and then enter the path related to the volumes or qtrees that are selected separated by commas.
* You can select multiple volumes and qtrees.
* If resource type is LUN, entire LUN is restored. You can select multiple LUNs.
  +
NOTE: If you select *All*, all the files on the volumes, qtrees, or LUNs are restored.

. In the *Pre ops* page, enter pre restore and unmount commands to run before performing a restore job.
. In the *Post ops* page, enter mount and post restore commands to run after performing a restore job.
. In the *Notification* page, from the *Email preference* drop-down list, select the scenarios in which you want to send the emails.
+
You must also specify the sender and receiver email addresses, and the subject of the email. SMTP must also be configured in the *Settings* > *Global Settings* page.

. Review the summary, and then click *Finish*.
. Monitor the operation progress by clicking *Monitor* > *Jobs*.
