You should configure the CA certificate with Windows host plug-in services to activate the installed digital certificate.

Perform the following step on the SnapCenter Server and all the plug-in hosts where CA certificates are already deployed.

*Steps*

. Remove the existing certificate binding with SMCore default port 8145, by running the following command:

  netsh http delete sslcert ipport=0.0.0.0:<SMCore Port>

. Bind the newly installed certificate with the Windows host plug-in services, by running the following commands:
+
``> $cert = “<certificate thumbprint>”``
+
``> $guid = [guid]::NewGuid().ToString("B")``
+
``> netsh http add sslcert ipport=0.0.0.0: <SMCore Port> certhash=$cert appid="$guid"``
