[.lead]
Before you add a host and install the plug-ins packages, you must complete all the requirements. The Custom Plug-ins can be used in both Windows and Linux environments.

* You must have created a custom plug-in. For details, see the developer information.
+
link:concept_develop_a_plug_in_for_your_application.html[Develop a plug-in for your application]
* If you want to manage MySQL or DB2 applications, you must have downloaded the MySQL and DB2 Custom Plug-ins that are provided by NetApp.
* You must have installed Java 1.8 or Java 11 (64-bit) on your Linux or Windows host.
* When installing a plug-in on a Windows host, if you specify a credential that is not built-in, or if the user belongs to a local workgroup user, you must disable UAC on the host.
* The Custom Plug-ins must be available on the client host from where the add host operation is performed.

== General

If you are using iSCSI, the iSCSI service should be running.

== SHA512 hash

* For custom plug-ins provided by NetApp, you should ensure that you have added the SHA512 hash of the custom plug-in file to the _custom_plugin_checksum_list_ file.
** For Linux host, the SHA512 hash is located at _/var/opt/snapcenter/scc/custom_plugin_checksum_list.txt_
** For Windows host, the SHA512 hash is located at
_C:\Program Files\NetApp\SnapCenter Plug-in Creator\etc\custom_plugin_checksum_list.txt_
+
For custom installation path, the SHA512 hash is located at _<custom path>\NetApp\SnapCenter\Snapcenter Plug-in Creator\etc\custom_plugin_checksum_list.txt_


+
The custom_plugin_checksum_list is part of the custom plug-in installation on the host by SnapCenter.

* For custom plug-ins created for your application, you should have performed the following steps:

. Generated the SHA512 hash of the plug-in zip file.
+
You can use online tools like https://emn178.github.io/online-tools/sha512_file_hash.html[SHA512 hash^].

. Added the generated SHA512 hash to the custom_plugin_checksum_list file in a new line.
+
The comments start with # symbol to identify the plug-in to which the hash belongs.
+
Following is an example of an entry of SHA512 hash in the checksum file:

== Windows hosts

* You must have a domain user with local administrator privileges with local login permissions on the remote host.
* If you manage cluster nodes in SnapCenter, you must have a user with administrative privileges to all the nodes in the cluster.

== Linux hosts

* You must have enabled the password-based SSH connection for the root or non-root user.
* You must have installed Java 1.8 or Java 11 (64-bit), on your Linux host.
+
If you are using Windows Server 2019 or Windows Server 2016 for the SnapCenter Server host, you must install Java 1.8 or Java 11 (64-bit). The Interoperability Matrix Tool (IMT) contains the latest information about requirements.

* You must configure sudo privileges for the non-root user to provide access to several paths. Add the following lines to the /etc/sudoers file by using the visudo Linux utility. 
+
NOTE: Ensure that you are using Sudo version 1.8.7 or later.

_LINUX_USER_ is the name of the non-root user that you created.
+
You can obtain the _checksum_value_ from the *oracle_checksum.txt* file, which is located at _C:\ProgramData\NetApp\SnapCenter\Package Repository_.
