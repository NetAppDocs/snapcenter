Before you add a host and install the plug-ins packages, you must complete all the requirements. The Custom Plug-ins can be used in both Windows and Linux environments.

* You must have created a custom plug-in. For details, see the developer information.

* If you want to manage MySQL or DB2 applications, you must have downloaded the MySQL and DB2 Custom Plug-ins that are provided by NetApp.
* You must have installed Java 1.8, 64-bit on your Linux or Windows host.
* When installing a plug-in on a Windows host, if you specify a credential that is not built-in, or if the user belongs to a local workgroup user, you must disable UAC on the host.
* The Custom Plug-ins must be available on the client host from where the add host operation is performed.

== General

If you are using iSCSI, the iSCSI service must be running.

== Windows hosts

* You must have a domain user with local administrator privileges with local login permissions on the remote host.
* If you manage cluster nodes in SnapCenter, you must have a user with administrative privileges to all the nodes in the cluster.

== Linux hosts

* You must have enabled the password-based SSH connection for the root or non-root user.
* You must have installed Java 1.8 64-bit, on your Linux host.
+
If you are using Windows 2019 or Windows 2016 for the SnapCenter Server host, you must install Java 1.8, 64-bit. The Interoperability Matrix Tool (IMT) contains the latest information about requirements.
