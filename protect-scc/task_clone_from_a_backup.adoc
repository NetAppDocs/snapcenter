You can use SnapCenter to clone a backup. You can clone from primary or secondary backup. The capabilities of the clone operations depends upon the plug-in that you use.

*What you will need*

* You must have backed up the resources or resource group.
* The default clone operation only clones storage objects. Clone operations at the application level can only be performed if the custom plug-in provides that capability.
* You should ensure that the aggregates hosting the volumes should be in the assigned aggregates list of the storage virtual machine (SVM).

*Steps*

. In the left navigation pane, click *Resources*, and then select the appropriate plug-in from the list.
. In the Resources page, filter resources from the *View* drop-down list based on resource type.
+
The resources are displayed along with information such as type, host or cluster name, associated resource groups and policies, and status.

. Select the resource or resource group.
+
You must select a resource if you select a resource group.
+
The resource or resource group topology page is displayed.

. From the Manage Copies view, select *Backups* either from the primary or secondary (mirrored or vaulted) storage systems.
. Select the data backup from the table, and then click image:../media/clone_icon.gif[clone icon].
. In the Locations page, perform the following:

| For this field...| Do this...

a|
Clone server
a|
By default, the source host is populated.

If you want to specify a different host, select the host on which the clone should be mounted and the plug-in is installed.
a|
Clone suffix
a|
This is mandatory when the clone destination is the same as the source.

Enter a suffix that will be appended to the newly cloned resource name. The suffix ensures that the cloned resource is unique on the host.

For example, rs1_clone. If you are cloning to the same host as the original resource, you must provide a suffix to differentiate the cloned resource from the original resource; otherwise, the operation fails.

|===
If the resource selected is a LUN and if you are cloning from a secondary backup, then the destination volumes are listed. Single source can have multiple destination volumes.

. In the Settings page, perform the following:
+
|===
| For this field...| Do this...

a|
Initiator name
a|
Enter the host initiator name, which is either a IQDN or WWPN.
a|
Igroup protocol
a|
Select Igroup protocol.
|===
NOTE: Settings page is displayed only if the storage type is LUN.

. In the Scripts page, enter the commands for pre clone or post clone that should be run before or after the clone operation, respectively. Enter the mount command to mount a file system to a host.
+
For example:
+
* Pre clone command: delete existing databases with the same name
+
* Post clone command: verify a database or start a database.
+
Mount command for a volume or qtree on a Linux machine: mount<VSERVER_NAME>:%<VOLUME_NAME_Clone /mnt>

. In the Notification page, from the *Email preference* drop-down list, select the scenarios in which you want to send the emails.
+
You must also specify the sender and receiver email addresses, and the subject of the email.

. Review the summary and click *Finish*.
. Monitor the operation progress by clicking *Monitor* > *Jobs*.
