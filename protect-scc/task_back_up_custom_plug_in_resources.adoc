You can also use PowerShell cmdlets manually or in scripts to perform backup, restore, and clone operations. For detailed information about PowerShell cmdlets, use the SnapCenter cmdlet help or see the https://library.netapp.com/ecm/ecm_download_file/ECMLP2883300[SnapCenter Software Cmdlet Reference Guide]
