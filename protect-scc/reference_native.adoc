[.lead]

SnapCenter supports non-PERL programming or scripting languages to create plug-ins. This is known as NATIVE style programming, which can be script or BATCH file.

The NATIVE-style plug-ins must follow certain conventions given below:

The plug-in must be executable

* For Unix systems, the user who runs the agent must have execute privileges on the plug-in
* For Windows systems, PowerShell plug-ins must have the suffix .ps1, other windows
scripts must have either .cmd or .bat suffix and must be executable by the user
* The plug-ins must react to command-line argument like "-quiesce", "-unquiesce"
* The plug-ins must return exit code 99 incase an operation or function is not implemented
* The plug-ins must use a specific syntax to pass results back to the server

== General plug-in handling

=== Logging error messages

Each operation can send messages back to the server, which displays and stores the content. A message contains the message level, a timestamp, and a message text. Multiline messages are supported.

Format:

  SC_MSG#<level>#<timestamp>#<message>
  SC_MESSAGE#<level>#<timestamp>#<message>

=== Using plug-in stubs
SnapCenter plug-ins must implement plug-in stubs. These are methods that the SnapCenter Server calls based on a specific workflow.

|===
| Plug-in Stub | Optional/Required | Purpose

a|
quiesce
a|
required
a|
This stub is responsible for performing a quiesce. It places the
application into a state where we can create a Snapshot copy. This is called before storage Snapshot copy operation.
a|
unquiesce
a|
required
a|
This stub is responsible for performing a unquiesce. It places
the application in a normal state. This is called after storage
Snapshot copy operation.
a|
clone_pre
a|
optional
a|
This stub is responsible for performing pre clone tasks. This assumes that you are using the built-in SnapCenter cloning interface and also is only triggered while performing action "clone_vol or clone_lun".
a|
clone_post
a|
Optional
a|
This stub is responsible for performing post clone tasks. This assumes you are using the built-in SnapCenter cloning interface and also is only triggered while performing "clone_vol or clone_lun" operations.
a|
restore_pre
a|
Optional
a|
This stub is responsible for performing pre restore tasks. This assumes you are using the built-in SnapCenter restore interface and is only triggered while performing restore operation.
a|
restore
a|
optional
a|
This stub is responsible for performing all restore actions. This
assumes you are not using built-in restore interface. It is triggered while performing restore operation.

=== Examples

==== Windows PowerShell

Check if the script can be executed on your system. If you cannot execute the script, set Set-ExecutionPolicy bypass for the script and retry the operation.

  if ($args.length -ne 1) {
    write-warning "You must specify a method";
    break;
  }
  function log ($level, $message) {
    $d = get-date
    echo "SC_MSG#$level#$d#$message"
  }
  function quiesce {
    $app_name = (get-item env:APP_NAME).value
    log "INFO" "Quiescing application using script $app_name";
    log "INFO" "Quiescing application finished successfully"
  }
  function unquiesce {
    $app_name = (get-item env:APP_NAME).value
    log "INFO" "Unquiescing application using script $app_name";
    log "INFO" "Unquiescing application finished successfully"
  }
    switch ($args[0]) {
      "-quiesce" {
      quiesce;
  }
  "-unquiesce" {
      unquiesce;
  }
  default {
      write-error "Function $args[0] is not implemented";
      exit 99;
    }
  }
  exit 0;
