You can develop custom plug-ins for applications that you use and then use SnapCenter to backup, restore, or clone these applications. Like other SnapCenter plug-ins, your custom plug-ins act as host-side components of the NetApp SnapCenter Software, enabling application-aware data protection and management of resources.

When Custom Plug-ins are installed, you can use SnapCenter with NetApp SnapMirror technology to create mirror copies of backup sets on another volume and use NetApp SnapVault technology to perform disk-to-disk backup replication. The Custom Plug-ins can be used in both Windows and Linux environments.

NOTE: SnapCenterCLI does not support SnapCenter Custom Plug-ins commands.

NetApp provides the Storage plug-in to perform data protection operations of the data volume on the ONTAP storage using the custom plug-in framework built into SnapCenter.

You can install the custom plug-in and storage plug-in from the Add Host page.

NetApp also provides MySQL, MAXDB, DB2, SYBASE, DPGLUE, MongoDB, ORASCPM, and PostgreSQL custom plug-ins. These plug-ins can be downloaded from the https://automationstore.netapp.com/home.shtml[NetApp Storage Automation Store^].

NOTE: SnapCenter support policy will cover support for SnapCenter custom plug-in framework, core engine, and the associated APIs. Support will not cover the plug-in source code and the associated scripts built on the custom plug-in framework.

You can create your own custom plug-ins by referring to link:concept_develop_a_plug_in_for_your_application.html[Develop a plug-in for your application^].
