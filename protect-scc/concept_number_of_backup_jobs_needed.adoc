Factors that determine the number of backup jobs that you need include the size of the resource, the number of volumes used, the rate of change of the resource, and your Service Level Agreement (SLA).

The number of backup jobs that you choose typically depends on the number of volumes on which you placed your resources. For example, if you placed a group of small resources on one volume and a large resource on another volume, you might create one backup job for the small resources and one backup job for the large resource.
