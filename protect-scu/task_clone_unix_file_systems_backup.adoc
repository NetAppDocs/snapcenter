You can use SnapCenter to clone Unix file system using the backup of the filesystem.

.Before you begin

* You can skip the fstab file update by setting the value of _SKIP_FSTAB_UPDATE_ to *true* in the _agent.properties_ file located at _/opt/NetApp/snapcenter/scc/etc_.
* You can have a static clone volume name and junction path by setting the value of _USE_CUSTOM_CLONE_VOLUME_NAME_FORMAT_ to *true* in the _agent.properties_ file located at _/opt/NetApp/snapcenter/scc/etc_. After updating the file, you should restart the SnapCenter for custom plug-in service by running the command: `/opt/NetApp/snapcenter/scc/bin/scc restart`.
+
Example: Without this property the clone volume name and junction path will be like <Source_volume_name>_Clone_<Timestamp> but now it will be <Source_volume_name>_Clone_<Clone_Name>
+
This keeps the name constant so that you can manually keep the fstab file updated if you do not prefer to update the fstab by SnapCenter.

.Steps

. In the left navigation pane, click *Resources*, and then select the appropriate plug-in from the list.
. In the Resources page, select either *Path* or *Resource Group* from the *View* list.
. Select the file system from either the details view or the resource group details view.
+
The topology page is displayed.

. From the Manage Copies view, select the backups either from Local copies (primary), Mirror copies (secondary), or Vault copies (secondary).
. Select the backup from the table, and then click *image:../media/clone_icon.gif[clone icon]*.

. In the Scripts page, perform the following steps:

NOTE: You should check if the commands exist in the command list available on the plug-in host from the _/opt/NetApp/snapcenter/scc/allowed_commands.config_ path.

. In the Notification page, from the *Email preference* drop-down list, select the scenarios in which you want to send the emails.
+
You must also specify the sender and receiver email addresses, and the subject of the email. If you want to attach the report of the clone operation performed, select *Attach Job Report*.
+
NOTE: For email notification, you must have specified the SMTP server details using the either the GUI or the PowerShell command Set-SmSmtpServer.

. Review the summary, and then click *Finish*.
. Monitor the operation progress by clicking *Monitor* > *Jobs*.
