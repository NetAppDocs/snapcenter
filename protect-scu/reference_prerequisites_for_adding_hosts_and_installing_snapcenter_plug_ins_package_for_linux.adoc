[.lead]
Before you add a host and install the plug-ins package for Linux, you must complete all the requirements.

* If you are using iSCSI, the iSCSI service must be running.
* You can either use the password-based authentication for the root or non-root user or SSH key based authentication.
+
SnapCenter Plug-in for Unix File Systems can be installed by a non-root user. However, you should configure the sudo privileges for the non-root user to install and start the plug-in process. After installing the plug-in, the processes will be running as an effective non-root user.

* Create credentials with authentication mode as Linux for the install user.
* You must have installed Java 11 on your Linux host.
+
NOTE: Ensure that you have installed only the certified edition of JAVA 11 on the Linux host.
