In the event of data loss, you can use SnapCenter to restore Unix file systems.

*About this task*

* You should execute the following commands to establish the connection with the SnapCenter Server, list the backups and retrieve its information, and restore the backup.
+
The information regarding the parameters that can be used with the command and their descriptions can be obtained by running Get-Help _command_name_. Alternatively, you can also refer to the https://library.netapp.com/ecm/ecm_download_file/ECMLP3323470[SnapCenter Software Command Reference Guide^].

* For SnapMirror active sync restore operation, you must select the backup from the primary location.

.Steps

. In the left navigation pane, click *Resources*, and then select the appropriate plug-in from the list.
. In the Resources page, select either *Path* or *Resource Group* from the *View* list.
. Select the file system from either the details view or the resource group details view.
+
The topology page is displayed.

. From the Manage Copies view, select *Backups* from either the primary or the secondary (mirrored or replicated) storage systems.
. Select the backup from the table, and then click *image:../media/restore_icon.gif[restore icon]*.
. In the Restore Scope page:
* For NFS file systems, by default *Connect and Copy* restore is selected. You can also select *Volume Revert* or *Fast Restore*.
* For non NFS file systems, the restore scope is selected depending on the layout.
+
The new files created after backup may not be available after restore depending on the file system type and layout.
. In the PreOps page, enter pre restore commands to run before performing a restore job.
. In the PostOps page, enter post restore commands to run after performing a restore job.
+
NOTE: You should check if the commands exist in the command list available on the plug-in host at location _/opt/NetApp/snapcenter/scc/etc/allowed_commands.config_ path.
. In the Notification page, from the *Email preference* drop-down list, select the scenarios in which you want to send the email notifications.
+
You must also specify the sender and receiver email addresses, and the subject of the email. If you want to attach the report of the restore operation performed, you must select *Attach Job Report*.
+
NOTE: For email notification, you must have specified the SMTP server details by using the either the GUI or the PowerShell command Set-SmSmtpServer.

. Review the summary, and then click *Finish*.
+
IMPORTANT: If restore operation fails, rollback is not supported.
+ 
NOTE: In case of restore of a filesystem residing on volume group, the old contents on the filesystem are not deleted. Only the content from the cloned filesystem will be copied to the source filesystem. This is applicable when there are multiple filesystems on the volume group and default NFS filesystem restores.
. Monitor the operation progress by clicking *Monitor* > *Jobs*.
