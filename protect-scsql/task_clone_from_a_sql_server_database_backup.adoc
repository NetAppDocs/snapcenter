You can use SnapCenter to clone a SQL Server database backup. If you want to access or restore an older version of the data, you can clone database backups on demand.

*What you will need*

* You should have prepared for data protection by completing tasks such as adding hosts, identifying resources, and creating storage system connections.
* You should have backed up databases or resource groups.
* The protection type such as mirror, vault, or mirror-vault for data LUN and log LUN should be same to discover secondary locators during cloning to an alternate host using log backups.
* If the mounted clone drive cannot be found during a SnapCenter clone operation, you should change the CloneRetryTimeout parameter of SnapCenter Server to 300.
* You should ensure that the aggregates hosting the volumes should be in the assigned aggregates list of the storage virtual machine (SVM).

*About this task*

* While cloning to a standalone database instance, ensure that the mount point path exists and it is a dedicated disk.
* While cloning to a Failover Cluster Instance (FCI), ensure that the mount points exists, it is a shared disk, and the path and the FCI should belong to the same SQL resource group.
* Ensure that there is only one vFC or FC initiator attached to each host. This is because, SnapCenter supports only one initiator per host.
* If the source database or the target instance is on a cluster shared volume (csv), then the cloned database will be on the csv.

NOTE: For virtual environments (VMDK/RDM), ensure that the mount point is a dedicated disk.

*Steps*

. In the left navigation pane, click *Resources*, and then select *SnapCenter Plug-in for SQL Server* from the list.
. In the Resources page, select either *Database* or *Resource Group* from the *View* list.
+
NOTE: Cloning of a backup of an instance is not supported.

*Steps*

. Select the database or resource group.
. From the Manage Copies view page, select the backup either from primary or secondary (mirrored or vaulted) storage system.
. Select the backup, and then click *image:../media/clone_icon.gif[]*.
. In the Clone Options page, perform the following actions:
+
|===
| For this field...| Do this...

a|
Clone server
a|
Choose a host on which the clone should be created.
a|
Clone instance
a|
Choose a clone instance to which you want to clone the database backup.

This SQL instance must be located in the specified clone server.
a|
Clone suffix
a|
Enter a suffix that will be appended to the clone file name to identify that the database is a clone.

For example, _db1_clone_. If you are cloning to the same location as the original database, you must provide a suffix to differentiate the cloned database from the original database. Otherwise, the operation fails.
a|
Auto assign mount point or Auto assign volume mount point under path
a|
Choose whether to automatically assign a mount point or a volume mount point under a path.

Auto assign volume mount point under path: The mount point under a path allows you to provide a specific directory. The mount points will be created within that directory. Before you choose this option, you must ensure that the directory is empty. If there is a database in the directory, the database will be in an invalid state after the mount operation.

|===

. In the Logs page, select one of the following options:
+
|===
| For this field...| Do this...

a|
None
a|
Choose this option when you want to clone only the full backup without any logs.
a|
All log backups
a|
Choose this option to clone all the available log backups dated after the full backup.
a|
By log backups until
a|
Choose this option to clone the database based on the backup logs that were created up to the backup log with the selected date.
a|
By specific date until
a|
Specify the date and time after which the transaction logs are not applied to the cloned database.

This point-in-time clone halts the clone of the transaction log entries that were recorded after the specified date and time.

|===

. In the Script page, enter the script timeout, path, and the arguments of the prescript or postscript that should be run before or after the clone operation, respectively.
+
For example, you can run a script to update SNMP traps, automate alerts, send logs, and so on.
+
The default script timeout is 60 seconds.

. In the Notification page, from the *Email preference* drop-down list, select the scenarios in which you want to send the emails.
+
You must also specify the sender and receiver email addresses, and the subject of the email. If you want to attach the report of the clone operation performed, select *Attach Job Report*.
+
NOTE: For email notification, you must have specified the SMTP server details using the either the GUI or the PowerShell command Set-SmSmtpServer.

For EMS, you can refer to https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/snapcenter/admin/concept_manage_ems_data_collection.html[Manage EMS data collection]

. Review the summary, and then click *Finish*.
. Monitor the operation progress by clicking *Monitor* > *Jobs*.

*After you finish*

After the clone is created, you should never rename it.
