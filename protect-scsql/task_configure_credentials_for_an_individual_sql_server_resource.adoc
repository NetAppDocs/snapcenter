[.lead]
You can configure credentials to perform data protection jobs on individual SQL Server resource for each user. While you can configure the credentials globally, you might want to do this only for a particular resource.

*About this task*

* If you are using Windows credentials for authentication, you must set up your credential before installing plug-ins.
+
However, if you are using an SQL Server instance for authentication, you must add the credential after installing plug-ins.

* If you have enabled SQL authentication while setting up the credentials, the discovered instance or database is shown with a red color padlock icon.
+
If the padlock icon appears, you must specify the instance or database credentials to successfully add the instance or database to a resource group.

* You must assign the credential to a role-based access control (RBAC) user without sysadmin access when the following conditions are met:
** The credential is assigned to an SQL instance.
** The SQL instance or host is assigned to an RBAC user.
+
The user must have both the resource group and backup privileges

*Steps*

. In the left navigation pane, click *Settings*.
. In the Settings page, click *Credential*.
. To add a new credential, click *New*.
. In the Credential page, configure the credentials:
