* Attach the LUN from secondary to the host machine with same drive letter.
*	Ensure that all the disks are connected using the same drive letter, which was used prior to DR.
*	Restart MSSQL server service.
* Ensure that the SQL databases are back online.

*Steps*

. In the *Settings* page, navigate to *Settings* > *Global Settings* > *Disaster Recovery*.
. Select *Enable Disaster Recovery*.
. Click *Apply*.

*After you finish*

* New databases are created after the failover and the databases will be in non-DR mode.
+
The new databases will continue to operate like they did before the failover.
* The new backups taken will be listed under SnapMirror or SnapVault (secondary) in the *Topology* page.
* All schedules will continue to work seamlessly.
* You can delete the SnapCenter Plug-in for SQL Server backups that were created during failover either by using the UI or the following cmdlet: ``Remove-SmDRFailoverBackups``
* After failover, if you want some of the resources to be in non-DR mode, use the following cmdlet: ``Set-SmDisasterRecovery``

* Partial DR is supported for a storage with resource group having resources that are in DR mode or non-DR mode.
