After you have provisioned your NetApp storage system using SnapCenter Plug-in for Microsoft Windows, you can migrate your resources to the NetApp storage system or from one NetApp LUN to another NetApp LUN using either the SnapCenter graphical user interface (GUI) or using the PowerShell cmdlets.

*What you will need*

* You must have added storage systems to SnapCenter Server.
* You must have refreshed (discovered) the SQL Server resources.

* Select *NO_INFOMSGS* option to suppress all of the informational messages.

* Select *ALL_ERRORMSGS* option to display all of the reported errors per object.

* Select *NOINDEX* option if you do not want to check nonclustered indexes.

The SQL Server database uses Microsoft SQL Server Database Consistency Checker (DBCC) to check the logical and physical integrity of the objects in the database.
+
NOTE: You might want to select this option to decrease the execution time.

* Select **TABLOCK** option to limit the checks and obtain locks instead of using an internal database Snapshot copy.
