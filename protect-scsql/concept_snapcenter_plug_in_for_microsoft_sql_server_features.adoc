The Plug-in for SQL Server integrates with Microsoft SQL Server on the Windows host and with NetApp Snapshot copy technology on the storage system. To work with the Plug-in for SQL Server, you use the SnapCenter interface.

The Plug-in for SQL Server includes these major features:

* *Unified graphical user interface powered by SnapCenter*
+
The SnapCenter interface provides you with standardization and consistency across plug-ins and environments. The SnapCenter interface enables you to complete consistent backup and restore processes across plug-ins, use centralized reporting, use at-a-glance dashboard views, set up role-based access control (RBAC), and monitor jobs across all plug-ins. SnapCenter also offers centralized scheduling and policy management to support backup and clone operations.

* *Automated central administration*
+
You can schedule routine SQL Server backups, configure policy-based backup retention, and set up point-in-time and up-to-the-minute restore operations. You can also proactively monitor your SQL Server environment by configuring SnapCenter to send email alerts.

* *Nondisruptive NetApp Snapshot copy technology*
+
The Plug-in for SQL Server uses NetApp Snapshot copy technology with the NetApp SnapCenter Plug-in for Microsoft Windows. This enables you to back up databases in seconds and restore them quickly without taking SQL Server offline. Snapshot copies consume minimal storage space.

In addition to these major features, the Plug-in for SQL Server offers the following benefits:

* Backup, restore, clone, and verification workflow support
* RBAC-supported security and centralized role delegation
* Creation of space-efficient, point-in-time copies of production databases for testing or data extraction by using NetApp FlexClone technology
+
A FlexClone license is required on the storage system holding the clone.

* Nondisruptive and automated backup verification
* Ability to run multiple backups at the same time across multiple servers
* PowerShell cmdlets for scripting of backup, verify, restore, and clone operations
* Support for AlwaysOn Availability Groups (AGs) in SQL Server to accelerate AG setup, backup, and restore operations
* In-memory database and Buffer Pool Extension (BPE) as part of SQL Server 2014
* Support for backup of LUNs and virtual machine disks (VMDKs)
* Support for physical and virtualized infrastructures
* Support for iSCSI, Fibre Channel, FCoE, raw device mapping (RDM), and VMDK over NFS and VMFS
+
NOTE: NAS volumes should have a default export policy in storage virtual machine (SVM).

* Support for FileStream and file group in SQL Server standalone databases.
