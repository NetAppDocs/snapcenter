* Attach the LUN from secondary to the host machine with same drive letter.
*	Ensure that all the disks are connected using the same drive letters that were used prior to DR.
*	Restart MSSQL server service.
* Ensure that the SQL resources are back online.

*About this task*

Disaster recovery (DR) is not supported on VMDK and RDM configurations.

*Steps*

. In the Settings page, navigate to *Settings* > *Global Settings* > *Disaster Recovery*.
. Select *Enable Disaster Recovery*.
. Click *Apply*.
. Verify whether the DR job is enabled or not by clicking *Monitor* > *Jobs*.

*After you finish*

* If new databases are created after the failover, the databases will be in non-DR mode.
+
The new databases will continue to operate like they did before the failover.
* The new backups that were created in DR mode will be listed under SnapMirror or SnapVault (secondary) in the Topology page.
+
An "i" icon is displayed next to the new backups to indicate that these backups were created during DR mode.
* You can delete the SnapCenter Plug-in for SQL Server backups that were created during failover either by using the UI or the following cmdlet: `Remove-SmBackup`
* After failover, if you want some of the resources to be in non-DR mode, use the following cmdlet: `Remove-SmResourceDRMode`
+
For more information refer to the https://library.netapp.com/ecm/ecm_download_file/ECMLP2886205[SnapCenter Software Cmdlet Reference Guide^].
* SnapCenter Server will manage the individual storage resources(SQL databases) that are in DR or non-DR mode but not the resource group with storage resources that are in DR mode or non-DR mode.
