You can restore the backed-up SQL Server databases from the physical LUNs (RDM, iSCSI, or FCP) on a secondary storage system. The Restore feature is a multiphase process that copies all of the data and the log pages from a specified SQL Server backup residing on the secondary storage system to a specified database.

*What you will need*

* You must have replicated the Snapshot copies from primary to secondary storage system.

* You must ensure that the SnapCenter Server and the plug-in host are able to connect to the secondary storage system.

* Most of the fields on the Restore wizard pages are explained in the basic restore process. The following information describes some of the fields for which you might need guidance.

*Steps*

. In the left navigation pane, click *Resources*, and then select *SnapCenter Plug-in for SQL Server* from the list.
. On the Resources page, select *Database* or *Resource Group* from the *View* drop-down list.
. Select the database or resource group.
+
The database or resource group topology page is displayed.

. In the Manage Copies section, select *Backups* from the secondary storage system (mirrored or vault).
. Select the backup from the list, and then click image:../media/restore_icon.gif[restore icon].
. On the *Location* page, choose the destination volume for restoring selected resource.
. Complete the Restore wizard, review the summary, and then click *Finish*.

If you restored a database to a different path that is shared by other databases, you should perform a full backup and backup verification to confirm that your restored database is free of physical-level corruption.
