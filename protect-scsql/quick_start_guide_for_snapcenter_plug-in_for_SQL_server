[.lead]
SnapCenter consists of the SnapCenter Server and SnapCenter plug-ins. This Quick Start Guide is a condensed set of installation instructions for installing the SnapCenter Server and the SnapCenter Plug-in for Microsoft SQL Server. For more details, see the http://docs.netapp.com/ocsc-44/topic/com.netapp.doc.ocsc-isg/home.html [SnapCenter Installation and Setup Guide.^]

== Preparing for installation

.Domain and workgroup requirements

SnapCenter Server can be installed on systems that are either in a domain or in a workgroup.

If you are using an Active Directory domain, you should use a Domain user with local administrator rights. The Domain user should be a member of the local Administrator group on the Windows host.

If you are using workgroups, you should use a local account that has local administrator rights.

== Licensing requirements

The type of licenses you install depends on your environment.

|===
| License | Where required

| SnapCenter Standard controller-based
| Required for FAS or AFF storage controllers
SnapCenter Standard license is a controller-based license and is included as part of the premium bundle. If you have the SnapManager Suite license, you also get the SnapCenter Standard license entitlement.
If you want to install SnapCenter on a trial basis with FAS or AFF storage, you can obtain a Premium Bundle evaluation license by contacting the sales representative.
| SnapCenter Standard capacity-based
| SnapCenter Standard capacity-based
If you are a Cloud Volumes ONTAP or ONTAP Select customer, you need to procure a per TB capacity-based license based on the data managed by SnapCenter.
By default, SnapCenter ships a built-in 90-day 100 TB SnapCenter Standard capacity-based trial license. For other details, contact the sales representative.
| SnapMirror or SnapVault
| ONTAP
Either SnapMirror or SnapVault license is required if replication is enabled in SnapCenter.
| Additional licenses (optional)
| See the https://library.netapp.com/ecm/ecm_download_file/ECMLP2874308 [SnapCenter Release Notes.^]
| SnapCenter Standard licenses (optional)
| Secondary destinations
NOTE: It is recommended, but not required, that you add SnapCenter Standard licenses to secondary destinations. If SnapCenter Standard licenses are not enabled on secondary destinations, you cannot use SnapCenter to backup resources on the secondary destination after performing a failover operation. However, a FlexClone license is required on secondary destinations to perform clone and verification operations.

|CPU
|*Server host: 4 cores
*Plug-in host: 1 core
|RAM
|*Server host: 8 GB
*Plug-in host: 1 GB
|Hard drive space
|*Server host:
  **4 GB for SnapCenter Server software and logs
  **6 GB for SnapCenter repository
*Each plug-in host: 2 GB for plug-in installation and logs, this is required only if plug-in is installed on a dedicated host.
|Third-party libraries
|Required on SnapCenter Server host and plug-in host:
* Microsoft .NET Framework 4.5.2 or later
* Windows Management Framework (WMF) 4.0 or later
* PowerShell 4.0 or later
|Browsers
|Chrome, Internet Explorer, and Microsoft Edge
|===

|===
|Port type |Default port
|SnapCenter port
|8146 (HTTPS), bidirectional, customizable, as in the URL `https://server:8146`
|SnapCenter SMCore communication port
|8145 (HTTPS), bidirectional, customizable
|Repository database
|3306 (HTTPS), bidirectional
|Windows plug-in hosts
|135, 445 (TCP)
In addition to ports 135 and 445, the dynamic port range specified by Microsoft should also be open. Remote install operations use the Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) service, which dynamically searches this port range.
For information on the dynamic port range supported, see https://docs.microsoft.com/en-US/troubleshoot/windows-server/networking/service-overview-and-network-port-requirements [Microsoft Support Article 832017: Service overview and network port requirements for Windows.^]
|SnapCenter Plug-in for Windows
|8145 (HTTPS), bidirectional, customizable
|ONTAP cluster or SVM communication port
|443 (HTTPS), bidirectional
80 (HTTP), bidirectional
The port is used for communication between the SnapCenter Server host, plug-in host, and SVM or ONTAP Cluster.
|===

|===
|SnapCenter Plug-in for Microsoft SQL Server requirements
|* You should have a user with local administrator privileges with local login permissions on the remote host. If you manage cluster nodes, you need a user with administrative privileges to all the nodes in the cluster.
* You should have a user with sysadmin permissions on the SQL Server. The plug-in uses Microsoft VDI Framework, which requires sysadmin access.
* If you were using SnapManager for Microsoft SQL Server and want to import data from SnapManager for Microsoft SQL Server to SnapCenter, see the http://docs.netapp.com/ocsc-44/topic/com.netapp.doc.ocsc-isg/home.html [SnapCenter Installation and Setup Guide.^]

== Installing SnapCenter Server

=== Downloading and installing SnapCenter Server

. Download the SnapCenter Server installation package from the https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/products/all/details/snapcenter/downloads-tab [NetApp Support Site^] and then double-click the exe.
+
After you initiate the installation, all the prechecks are performed and if the minimum requirements are not met appropriate error or warning messages are displayed. You can ignore the warning messages and proceed with installation; however, errors should be fixed.
. Review the pre-populated values required for the SnapCenter Server installation and modify if required.
+
You do not have to specify the password for MySQL Server repository database. During SnapCenter Server installation the password is auto generated.

[NOTE]
The special character “%” is not supported in the custom path for installation. If you include “%” in the path, installation fails.
. Click *Install Now*.

=== Logging in to SnapCenter

. Launch SnapCenter from a shortcut on the host desktop or from the URL provided by the installation (`https://server:8146` for default port 8146 where SnapCenter Server is installed).
. Enter the credentials. For a built-in domain admin username format, use: `NetBIOS\<username>` or `<username>@<domain>` or `<DomainFQDN>\<username>`. For a built-in local admin username format, use `<username>`.
. Click *Sign In*.

=== Adding SnapCenter licenses
