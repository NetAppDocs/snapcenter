[.lead]
You can install the SnapCenter Plug-in for Microsoft SQL Server on multiple hosts simultaneously by using the Install-SmHostPackage PowerShell cmdlet.

*What you will need*

You must have logged in to SnapCenter as a domain user with local administrator rights on each host on which you want to install the plug-in package.

*Steps*

. Launch PowerShell.
. On the SnapCenter Server host, establish a session using the Open-SmConnection cmdlet, and then enter your credentials.
. Install the SnapCenter Plug-in for Microsoft SQL Server on multiple remote hosts using the Install-SmHostPackage cmdlet and the required parameters.
+
The information regarding the parameters that can be used with the cmdlet and their descriptions can be obtained by running _Get-Help command_name_. Alternatively, you can also refer to the https://library.netapp.com/ecm/ecm_download_file/ECMLP2880726[SnapCenter Software Cmdlet Reference Guide^].
+
You can use the -skipprecheck option when you have already installed the plug-ins manually and you do not want to validate whether the host meets the requirements for installing the plug-in.

. Enter your credentials for remote installation.
