[.lead]
After the SnapCenter Plug-in for SQL Server primary storage is back online, you should failback to the primary storage.

*What you will need*

* Place the SnapCenter Plug-in for SQL Server in *Maintenance* mode from the Managed Hosts page.
* Disconnect the secondary storage from the host and connect from the primary storage.
* To failback to the primary storage, ensure that the relationship direction remains the same as it was before the failover by performing the reverse resync operation.
+
To retain the roles of primary and secondary storage after the reverse resync operation, perform  the reverse resync operation once again.

* Ensure that the SQL resources are back online.

*Steps*

. In the Settings page, navigate to *Settings* > *Global Settings* > *Disaster Recovery*.

. Click *Apply*.
. Verify whether the DR job is enabled or not by clicking *Monitor* > *Jobs*.

* You can delete the SnapCenter Plug-in for SQL Server backups that were created during failover either by using the UI or the following cmdlet: `Remove-SmDRFailoverBackups`
