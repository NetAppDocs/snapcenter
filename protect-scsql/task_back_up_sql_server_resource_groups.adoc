You can back up a resource group on demand from the Resources page. If a resource group has a policy attached and a schedule configured, then backups occur automatically according to the schedule.

.Steps

. In the left navigation pane, select *Resources*, and then select the appropriate plug-in from the list.
. In the Resources page, select *Resource Group* from the *View* list.
+
You can search the resource group either by entering the resource group name in the search box, or by selecting *image:../media/filter_icon.gif[Filter icon]*, and then selecting the tag. You can then select *image:../media/filter_icon.gif[Filter icon]* to close the filter pane.

. In the Resource Groups page, select the resource group that you want to back up, and then select *Back up Now*.
. In the Backup page, perform the following steps:
 .. If you have associated multiple policies with the resource group, from the *Policy* drop-down list, select the policy that you want to use for backup.
+
If the policy selected for the on-demand backup is associated with a backup schedule, the on-demand backups will be retained based on the retention settings specified for the schedule type.

 .. After backup, select *Verify* to verify the on-demand backup.
+
The *Verify* option in the policy applies only to scheduled jobs.

 .. Select *Backup*.
. Monitor the operation progress by selecting *Monitor* > *Jobs*.
