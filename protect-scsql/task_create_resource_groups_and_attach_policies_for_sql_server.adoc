A resource group is a container to which you add resources that you want to back up and protect together. A resource group enables you to back up all of the data that is associated with a given application simultaneously. A resource group is required for any data protection job. You must also attach one or more policies to the resource group to define the type of data protection job that you want to perform.

You can protect resources individually without creating a new resource group. You can take backups on the protected resource.
