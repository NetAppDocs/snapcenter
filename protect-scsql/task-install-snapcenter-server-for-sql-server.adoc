Provides a condensed set of installation instructions for installing the SnapCenter Server for Microsoft SQL Server.

== Step 1: Download and install SnapCenter Server

. Download the SnapCenter Server installation package from the https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/products/all/details/snapcenter/downloads-tab[NetApp Support Site^] and then double-click the exe.
+
After you initiate the installation, all the prechecks are performed and if the minimum requirements are not met appropriate error or warning messages are displayed. You can ignore the warning messages and proceed with installation; however, errors should be fixed.
. Review the pre-populated values required for the SnapCenter Server installation and modify if required.
+
You do not have to specify the password for MySQL Server repository database. During SnapCenter Server installation the password is auto generated.
+
NOTE: The special character “%” is not supported in the custom path for installation. If you include “%” in the path, installation fails.

. Click *Install Now*.

== Step 2: Log in to SnapCenter

. Launch SnapCenter from a shortcut on the host desktop or from the URL provided by the installation (_\https://server:8146_ for default port 8146 where SnapCenter Server is installed).
. Enter the credentials.
+
For a built-in domain admin username format, use: _NetBIOS\<username>_ or _<username>@<domain>_ or _<DomainFQDN>\<username>_.
+
For a built-in local admin username format, use _<username>_.
. Click *Sign In*.

== Step 3: Add a SnapCenter Standard controller-based license

. Verify the license:

== Step 4: Add a SnapCenter capacity-based license

. In the SnapCenter GUI left pane, click *Settings > Software*, and then in the License section, click *+*.
. Select one of two methods for obtaining the license:

** Browse to the location of the NetApp License File and click *Open*.
. In the Notifications page of the wizard, use the default capacity threshold of 90 percent.
. Click *Finish*.
