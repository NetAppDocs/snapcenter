The SnapCenter Plug-in for Microsoft SQL Server is a host-side component of the NetApp SnapCenter Software that enables application-aware data protection management of Microsoft SQL Server databases. The Plug-in for SQL Server automates SQL Server database backup, verify, restore, and cloning operations in your SnapCenter environment.

When the Plug-in for SQL Server is installed, you can use SnapCenter with NetApp SnapMirror technology to create mirror copies of backup sets on another volume and with NetApp SnapVault technology to perform disk-to-disk backup replication for standards compliance or archival purposes.
