You can use SnapCenter to configure an FC-connected or iSCSI-connected LUN. You can also use SnapCenter to connect an existing LUN to a Windows host.

LUNs are the basic unit of storage in a SAN configuration. The Windows host sees LUNs on your system as virtual disks. For more information, see http://docs.netapp.com/ontap-9/topic/com.netapp.doc.dot-cm-sanconf/home.html[ONTAP 9 SAN Configuration Guide^].
