You should configure the CA certificates and enable the CA certificate validation for the SnapCenter Server.

*What you will need*

* You can enable or disable the CA certificates using the Set-SmCertificateSettings cmdlet.
* You can display the certificate status for the SnapCenter Server using the Get-SmCertificateSettings cmdlet.

The information regarding the parameters that can be used with the cmdlet and their descriptions can be obtained by running _Get-Help command_name_. Alternatively, you can refer to the https://library.netapp.com/ecm/ecm_download_file/ECMLP2880726[SnapCenter Software Cmdlet Reference Guide^].

*Steps*

. In the Settings page, navigate to *Settings* > *Global Settings* > *CA Certificate Settings*.
. Select *Enable Certificate Validation*.
. Click *Apply*.

*After you finish*

The Managed Hosts tab host displays a padlock and the color of the padlock indicates the status of the connection between SnapCenter Server and the plug-in host.

* *image:../media/enable_ca_issues_icon.png[]* indicates that there is no CA certificate enabled or assigned to the plug-in host.
* *image:../media/enable_ca_good_icon.png[]* indicates that the CA certificate is successfully validated.

* *image:../media/enable_ca_failed_icon.png[]* indicates that the CA certificate could not be validated.
*  *image:../media/enable_ca_undefined_icon.png[]* indicates that the connection information could not be retrieved.

NOTE: When the status is yellow or green, the data protection operations completes successfully.
