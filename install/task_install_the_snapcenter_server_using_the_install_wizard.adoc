You can run the SnapCenter Server installer executable to install the SnapCenter Server.

You can optionally perform several installation and configuration procedures by using PowerShell cmdlets. You should be using PowerShell 7.4.2 or later.

NOTE: Silent installation of the SnapCenter Server from the command-line is not supported.

.Before you begin

* The SnapCenter Server host must be up to date with Windows updates with no pending system restarts.
* You should have ensured that MySQL Server is not installed on the host where you plan to install the SnapCenter Server.
* You should have enabled Windows installer debugging.
+
See the Microsoft web site for information about enabling https://support.microsoft.com/kb/223300[Windows installer logging^].
+
NOTE: You should not install the SnapCenter Server on a host that has Microsoft Exchange Server, Active Directory, or Domain Name Servers.

.Steps

. Download the SnapCenter Server installation package from https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/products/all/details/snapcenter/downloads-tab[NetApp Support Site^].
. Initiate the SnapCenter Server installation by double-clicking the downloaded .exe file.
+
After you initiate the installation, all the prechecks are performed and if the minimum requirements are not met appropriate error or warning messages are displayed.
+
You can ignore the warning messages and proceed with installation; however, errors should be fixed.

. Review the pre-populated values required for the SnapCenter Server installation and modify if required.
+
You do not have to specify the password for MySQL Server repository database. During SnapCenter Server installation the password is auto generated.
+
NOTE: The special character "`%`" is not supported in the custom path for the repository database. If you include "`%`" in the path, installation fails.

. Click *Install Now*.
+
If you have specified any values that are invalid, appropriate error messages will be displayed. You should reenter the values, and then initiate the installation.
+
NOTE: If you click the *Cancel* button, the step that is being executed will be completed, and then start the rollback operation. The SnapCenter Server will be completely removed from the host.

+
However, if you click *Cancel* when "SnapCenter Server site restart" or "Waiting for SnapCenter Server to start" operations are being performed, installation will proceed without cancelling the operation.
+
Log files are always listed (oldest first) in the %temp% folder of the admin user. If you want to redirect the log locations, initiate the SnapCenter Server installation from the command prompt by running:``C:\installer_location\installer_name.exe /log"C:\"``

== Features enabled on Windows host during installation

The SnapCenter Server installer enables the Windows features and roles on your Windows host during installation. These might be of interest for troubleshooting and maintaining the host system.
