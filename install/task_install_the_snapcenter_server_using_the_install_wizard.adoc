You can run the SnapCenter Server installer executable to install the SnapCenter Server.

You can optionally perform several installation and configuration procedures by using PowerShell cmdlets.

NOTE: Silent installation of the SnapCenter Server from the command-line is not supported.

*What you will need*

* The SnapCenter Server host must be up to date with Windows updates with no pending system restarts.
* You should have ensured that MySQL Server is not installed on the host where you plan to install the SnapCenter Server.
* You should have enabled Windows installer debugging.
+
See the Microsoft web site for information about enabling https://support.microsoft.com/kb/223300[Windows installer logging^].
+
NOTE: You should not install the SnapCenter Server on a host that has Microsoft Exchange Server, Active Directory, or Domain Name Servers.

*Steps*

. Download the SnapCenter Server installation package from https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/products/all/details/snapcenter/downloads-tab[NetApp Support Site^].
. Initiate the SnapCenter Server installation by double-clicking the downloaded .exe file.
+
After you initiate the installation, all the prechecks are performed and if the minimum requirements are not met appropriate error or warning messages are displayed.
+
You can ignore the warning messages and proceed with installation; however, errors should be fixed.

. Review the pre-populated values required for the SnapCenter Server installation and modify if required.
+
You do not have to specify the password for MySQL Server repository database. During SnapCenter Server installation the password is auto generated.
+
NOTE: The special character "`%`" is not supported in the custom path for the repository database. If you include "`%`" in the path, installation fails.

. Click *Install Now*.
+
If you have specified any values that are invalid, appropriate error messages will be displayed. You should reenter the values, and then initiate the installation.
+
NOTE: If you click the *Cancel* button, the step that is being executed will be completed, and then start the rollback operation. The SnapCenter Server will be completely removed from the host.

+
However, if you click *Cancel* when "SnapCenter Server site restart" or "Waiting for SnapCenter Server to start" operations are being performed, installation will proceed without cancelling the operation.
+
Log files are always listed (oldest first) in the %temp% folder of the admin user. If you want to redirect the log locations, initiate the SnapCenter Server installation from the command prompt by running:``C:\installer_location\installer_name.exe /log"C:\"``
