You should register the Active Directory with SnapCenter Server to manage hosts, users, and groups from multiple untrusted Active Directory domains.

* The fully qualified domain name (FQDN) should be reachable from SnapCenter Server.
* If the FQDN is not resolvable, the domain controller IP addresses that are provided should be resolvable from SnapCenter Server.
* You should have enabled bidirectional communication between the plug-in hosts and the SnapCenter Server.
* DNS resolution should be set up from the SnapCenter Server to the plug-in hosts and vice-versa.
* To register an untrusted domain, you can use either the SnapCenter user interface or PowerShell cmdlets.
* You can register an untrusted domain with the FQDN. If the FQDN is not resolvable from the SnapCenter Server, you can register with an IP address.
