You should register the Active Directory with SnapCenter Server to manage hosts, users, and groups from multiple untrusted Active Directory domains.

*What you will need*

* The fully qualified domain name (FQDN) should be reachable from SnapCenter Server.
* If the FQDN is not resolvable, the domain controller IP addresses that are provided should be resolvable from SnapCenter Server.
* You should have enabled bidirectional communication between the plug-in hosts and the SnapCenter Server.
* DNS resolution should be set up from the SnapCenter Server to the plug-in hosts and vice-versa.

*About this task*

You can register an untrusted domain with the FQDN. If the FQDN is not resolvable from the SnapCenter Server, you can register with an IP address.

You can use either the SnapCenter user interface or PowerShell cmdlets to register an untrusted domain.
