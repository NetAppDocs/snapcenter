SnapCenter Standard license is a controller-based license and is included as part of the premium bundle. If you have the SnapManager Suite license, you also get the SnapCenter Standard license entitlement. If you want to install SnapCenter on a trial basis with FAS or AFF storage, you can obtain a Premium Bundle evaluation license by contacting the sales representative.

NOTE: SnapCenter is also offered as part of data protection bundle. If you have purchased A400 or later, you should purchase the data protection bundle.
