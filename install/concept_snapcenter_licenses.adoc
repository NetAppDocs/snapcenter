SnapCenter requires several licenses to enable data protection of applications, databases, file systems, and virtual machines. The type of SnapCenter licenses you install depends on your storage environment and the features that you want to use.

Required for FAS, AFF, All SAN Array (ASA)

SnapCenter Standard license is a controller-based license and is included as part of the ONTAP One. If you have the SnapManager Suite license, you also get the SnapCenter Standard license entitlement. If you want to install SnapCenter on a trial basis with FAS, AFF, or ASA storage, you can obtain a ONTAP One evaluation license by contacting the sales representative.

For information on licenses included with ONTAP One, refer to https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/system-admin/manage-licenses-concept.html#licenses-included-with-ontap-one[Licenses included with ONTAP One].

NOTE: SnapCenter is also offered as part of data protection bundle. If you have purchased A400 or later, you should purchase the data protection bundle.

== Single Mailbox Recovery (SMBR) licenses
If you are using SnapCenter Plug-in for Exchange to manage Microsoft Exchange Server databases and Single Mailbox Recovery (SMBR), you would need additional license for SMBR which needs to be purchased separately based on user mailbox.

NetAppÂ® Single Mailbox Recovery has come to the end of availability (EOA) on May 12, 2023. For more information, refer link:https://mysupport.netapp.com/info/communications/ECMLP2885729.html[CPC-00507].
