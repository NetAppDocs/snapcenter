You should configure the CA certificate with Windows host plug-in services to activate the installed digital certificate.

*Steps*

1. Bind the newly installed certificate with the Windows host plug-in services, by running the running the following command:
+
``> $cert = “<certificate thumbprint>”``
+
``> $guid = [guid]::NewGuid().ToString("B")``
+
``> netsh http add sslcert ipport=0.0.0.0: <SMCore Port> certhash=$cert appid="$guid"``
