Although NTFS tracks the available space on a LUN when files are deleted or modified, it does not report the new information to the storage system. You can run the space reclamation PowerShell cmdlet on the Plug-in for Windows host to ensure that newly freed blocks are marked as available in storage.

If you are running the cmdlet on a remote plug-in host, you must have run the SnapCenterOpen-SMConnection cmdlet to open a connection to the SnapCenter Server.

*What you will need*

* You must ensure that the space reclamation process has completed before performing a restore operation.
* If the LUN is shared by hosts in a Windows Server failover cluster, you must perform space reclamation on the host that owns the cluster group.
* For optimum storage performance, you should perform space reclamation as often as possible.
+
You should ensure that the entire NTFS file system has been scanned.

*About this task*

* Space reclamation is time-consuming and CPU-intensive, so it is usually best to run the operation when storage system and Windows host usage is low.
* Space reclamation reclaims nearly all available space, but not 100 percent.
* You should not run disk defragmentation at the same time as you are performing space reclamation.
+
Doing so can slow the reclamation process.

*Step*

From the application server PowerShell command prompt, enter the following command:

`Invoke-SdHostVolumeSpaceReclaim -Path drive_path`

drive_path is the drive path mapped to the LUN.
