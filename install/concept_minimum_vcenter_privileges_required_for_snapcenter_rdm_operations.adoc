[.lead]
To perform RDM operations in a guest OS, you must have minimum vCenter privileges.

You must have the following minimum privileges set on the host:

* Datastore: Remove File
* Host: Configuration > Storage Partition Configuration
* Virtual Machine: Configuration

You must assign these privileges to a role at the Virtual Center Server level. The role to which you assign these privileges cannot be assigned to any user without root privileges.

After you assign these privileges, you can install the Plug-in for Windows on the guest OS.
