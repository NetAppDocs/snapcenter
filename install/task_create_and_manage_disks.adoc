The Windows host sees LUNs on your storage system as virtual disks. You can use SnapCenter to create and configure an FC-connected or iSCSI-connected LUN.

Using SnapCenter, you can perform the following disk-related tasks:

* View the lists of disks on a host.
* Create a disk.
* Resize a disk.
* Connect to a disk.
* Disconnect from a disk.
* Delete a disk.

NOTE: SnapCenter does not support renaming a disk. If a disk that is managed by SnapCenter is renamed, SnapCenter operations will not succeed.
