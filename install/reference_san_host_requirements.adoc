If your SnapCenter host is part of a FC/iSCSI environment, you might need to install additional software on the system to enable access to ONTAP storage.

SnapCenter does not include Host Utilities or a DSM. If your SnapCenter host is part of a SAN environment, you might need to install and configure the following software:

* Host Utilities
+
The Host Utilities support FC and iSCSI, and it enables you to use MPIO on your Windows Servers.
For information, see https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-sanhost/[Host Utilities documentation^].

* Microsoft DSM for Windows MPIO
+
This software works with Windows MPIO drivers to manage multiple paths between NetApp and Windows host computers.
+
A DSM is required for high availability configurations.
+
NOTE: If you were using ONTAP DSM, you should migrate to Microsoft DSM.
