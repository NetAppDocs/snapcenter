You can configure Microsoft Network Load Balancing (NLB) to set up SnapCenter High Availability. From SnapCenter 4.2, you should manually configure NLB outside of SnapCenter installation for high availability.

For information about how to configure Network Load Balancing (NLB) with SnapCenter see https://kb.netapp.com/Advice_and_Troubleshooting/Data_Protection_and_Security/SnapCenter/How_to_configure_NLB_and_ARR_with_SnapCenter[How to configure NLB with SnapCenter^].

NOTE: SnapCenter 4.1.1 or earlier supported configuration of Network Load Balancing (NLB) while installing SnapCenter.
