You can enable two-way SSL communication to secure the communication between SnapCenter Server and MySQL Server. 

*What you will need*

* You should have generated CA Certificate CSR file
* You should have imported CA certificate
* You should have got the CA certificate thumbprint

*Steps*

. Remove the existing certificate binding with SMCore default port 8145, by running the following command:
+
 > netsh http delete sslcert ipport=0.0.0.0:_<SMCore Port>
+
For example:
+
  > netsh http delete sslcert ipport=0.0.0.0:8145

. Bind the newly installed certificate with the Windows host plug-in services and enable the two-way SSL communication by running the following commands: 
+
 > $cert = “_<certificate thumbprint>_”
 > $guid = [guid]::NewGuid().ToString("B")
 > netsh http add sslcert ipport=0.0.0.0: _<SMCore Port>_ certhash=$cert appid="$guid" clientcertnegotiation=enable
 > netsh http show sslcert ipport=0.0.0.0:<port>
+
. Add "IIS AppPool\SnapCenter" user to SnapCenter server CA certificate with mmc.
