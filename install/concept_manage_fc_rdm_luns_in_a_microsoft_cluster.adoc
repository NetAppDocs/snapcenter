You can use the Plug-in for Windows to manage a Microsoft cluster using FC RDM LUNs, but you must first create the shared RDM quorum and shared storage outside the plug-in, and then add the disks to the virtual machines in the cluster.

Starting with ESXi 5.5, you can also use ESX iSCSI and FCoE hardware to manage a Microsoft cluster. The Plug-in for Windows includes out-of-box support for Microsoft clusters.
