To configure an SMB3 share on a storage virtual machine (SVM), you can use either the SnapCenter user interface or PowerShell cmdlets.

|===
*Best Practice:* Using the cmdlets is recommended because it enables you to take advantage of templates provided with SnapCenter to automate share configuration.
|===
The templates encapsulate best practices for volume and share configuration. You can find the templates in the Templates folder in the installation folder for the SnapCenter Plug-ins Package for Windows.

TIP: If you feel comfortable doing so, you can create your own templates following the models provided. You should review the parameters in the cmdlet documentation before creating a custom template.

== Create an SMB share

You can use the SnapCenter Shares page to create an SMB3 share on a storage virtual machine (SVM).

You cannot use SnapCenter to back up databases on SMB shares. SMB support is limited to provisioning only.

*Steps*

. In the left navigation pane, click *Hosts*.
. In the Hosts page, click *Shares*.
. Select the SVM from the *Storage Virtual Machine* drop-down list.
. Click *New*.
+
The New Share dialog opens.

. In the New Share dialog, define the share:
+
|===
| In this field...| Do this...

a|
Description
a|
Enter descriptive text for the share.
a|
Share name
a|
Enter the share name, for example, test_share.

The name you enter for the share will also be used as the volume name.

The share name:

** Must be a UTF-8 string.
** Must not include the following characters: control characters from 0x00 to 0x1F (both inclusive), 0x22 (double quotes), and the special characters `\ / [ ] : (vertical bar) < > + = ; , ?`
a|
Share path
a|
 * Click in the field to enter a new file system path, for example, /.
 * Double-click in the field to select from a list of existing file system paths.
|===

. When you are satisfied with your entries, click *OK*.
+
SnapCenter creates the SMB share on the SVM.

== Delete an SMB share

You can delete an SMB share when you no longer need it.

*Steps*

. In the left navigation pane, click *Hosts*.
. In the Hosts page, click *Shares*.
. In the Shares page, click in the *Storage Virtual Machine* field to display a drop-down with a list of available storage virtual machines (SVMs), then select the SVM for the share you want to delete.
. From the list of shares on the SVM, select the share you want to delete and click *Delete*.
. In the Delete Share dialog box, click *OK*.
+
SnapCenter deletes the SMB share from the SVM.
