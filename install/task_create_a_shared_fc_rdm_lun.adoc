Before you can use FC RDM LUNs to share storage between nodes in a Microsoft cluster, you must first create the shared quorum disk and shared storage disk, and then add them to both virtual machines in the cluster.

The shared disk is not created using the Plug-in for Windows.

. Create and then add the shared LUN to each virtual machine in the cluster, as documented in the VMware _Setup for Failover Clustering and Microsoft Cluster Service_.

See the section that describes how to cluster virtual machines across physical hosts.
