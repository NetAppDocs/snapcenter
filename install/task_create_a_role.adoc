NOTE: Only the following special characters can be used in user names and group names: space ( ), hyphen (-), underscore (_), and colon (:).
. Select *All members of this role can see other members' objects* to enable other members of the role to see resources such as volumes and hosts after they refresh the resources list.
+
You should deselect this option if you do not want members of this role to see objects to which other members are assigned.

NOTE: When this option is enabled, assigning users access to objects or resources is not required if users belong to the same role as the user who created the objects or resources.
