Credentials use different authentication methods depending upon the application or environment. Credentials authenticate users so they can perform SnapCenter operations. You should create one set of credentials for installing plug-ins and another set for data protection operations.

== Windows authentication

The Windows authentication method authenticates against Active Directory. For Windows authentication, Active Directory is set up outside of SnapCenter. SnapCenter authenticates with no additional configuration. You need a Windows credential to perform tasks such as adding hosts, installing plug-in packages, and scheduling jobs.

== Untrusted domain authentication

SnapCenter allows the creation of Windows credentials using users and groups belonging to the untrusted domains. For the authentication to succeed, you should register the untrusted domains with SnapCenter.

== Local workgroup authentication

SnapCenter allows the creation of Windows credentials with local workgroup users and groups. The Windows authentication for local workgroup users and groups does not happen at the time of Windows credential creation but is deferred until the host registration and other host operations are performed.

== SQL Server authentication

The SQL authentication method authenticates against a SQL Server instance. This means that a SQL Server instance must be discovered in SnapCenter. Therefore, before adding a SQL credential, you must add a host, install plug-in packages, and refresh resources. You need SQL Server authentication for performing operations such as scheduling on SQL Server or discovering resources.

== Linux authentication

The Linux authentication method authenticates against a Linux host. You need Linux authentication during the initial step of adding the Linux host and installing the SnapCenter Plug-ins Package for Linux remotely from the SnapCenter GUI.

== AIX authentication

The AIX authentication method authenticates against an AIX host. You need AIX authentication during the initial step of adding the AIX host and installing the SnapCenter Plug-ins Package for AIX remotely from the SnapCenter GUI.

== Oracle database authentication

The Oracle database authentication method authenticates against an Oracle database. You need an Oracle database authentication to perform operations on the Oracle database if the operating system (OS) authentication is disabled on the database host. Therefore, before adding a Oracle database credential, you should create an Oracle user in the Oracle database with sysdba privileges.

== Oracle ASM authentication

The Oracle ASM authentication method authenticates against an Oracle Automatic Storage Management (ASM) instance. If you are required to access the Oracle ASM instance and if the operating system (OS) authentication is disabled on the database host, you need an Oracle ASM authentication. Therefore, before adding an Oracle ASM credential, you should create an Oracle user with sysasm privileges in the ASM instance.

== RMAN catalog authentication

The RMAN catalog authentication method authenticates against the Oracle Recovery Manager (RMAN) catalog database. If you have configured an external catalog mechanism and registered your database to catalog database, you need to add RMAN catalog authentication.
