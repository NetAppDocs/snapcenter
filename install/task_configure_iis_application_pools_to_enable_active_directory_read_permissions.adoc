You can configure Internet Information Services (IIS) on your Windows Server to create a custom Application Pool account when you need to enable Active Directory read permissions for SnapCenter.

*Steps*

. Open IIS Manager on the Windows Server where SnapCenter is installed.
. In the left navigation pane, click *Application Pools*.
. Select SnapCenter in the Application Pools list, and then click *Advanced Settings* in the Actions pane.
. Select Identity, and then click *...* to edit the SnapCenter application pool identity.
. In the Custom Account field, enter a domain user or domain admin account name with Active Directory read permission.
. Click OK.

The custom account replaces the built-in ApplicationPoolIdentity account for the SnapCenter application pool.
