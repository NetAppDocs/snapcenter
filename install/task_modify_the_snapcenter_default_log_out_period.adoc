You can modify the SnapCenter GUI session timeout period to make it less than or greater than the default timeout period of 20 minutes.

As a security feature, after a default period of 15 minutes of inactivity, SnapCenter warns you that you will be logged out of the GUI session in 5 minutes. By default, SnapCenter logs you out of the GUI session after 20 minutes of inactivity, and you must log in again.

*Steps*

. In the left navigation pane, click *Settings* > *Global Settings*.
. In the Global Settings page, click *Configuration Settings*.
. In the Session Timeout field, enter the new session timeout in minutes, and then click *Save*.
