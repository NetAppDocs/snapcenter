[.lead]

You should configure the two-way SSL communication to secure the mutual communication between SnapCenter Server on Windows host and the plug-ins.  

.Before you begin

* You should have generated the CA Certificate CSR file with the minimum supported key length of 3072.
* The CA certificate should support server authentication and client authentication. 
* You should have a CA certificate with private key and thumbprint details.
* You should have enabled the one-way SSL configuration.
+
For more details, see https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/snapcenter/install/reference_generate_CA_certificate_CSR_file.html[Configure CA certificate section.]
* You must have enabled two-way SSL communication on all the plug-in hosts and the SnapCenter Server.
+
Environment with some hosts or server not enabled for two-way SSL communication is not supported.

.Steps

. To bind the port, perform the following steps on SnapCenter Server host for SnapCenter IIS web server port 8146 (default) and once again for SMCore port 8145 (default) using PowerShell commands.
.. Remove the existing SnapCenter self-signed certificate port binding using the following PowerShell command. 
+
`> netsh http delete sslcert ipport=0.0.0.0:<SMCore port/IIS port>`
+
For example,
+
`> netsh http delete sslcert ipport=0.0.0.0:8145`
+
`> netsh http delete sslcert ipport=0.0.0.0:8146`

..	Bind the newly procured CA certificate with the SnapCenter server and SMCore port.
+
`> $cert = “<CA_certificate thumbprint>”`
+
`> $guid = [guid]::NewGuid().ToString("B")`
+
`> netsh http add sslcert ipport=0.0.0.0: <SMCore Port/IIS port> certhash=$cert appid="$guid"` `clientcertnegotiation=enable verifyclientcertrevocation=disable`
+
`> netsh http show sslcert ipport=0.0.0.0:<SMCore Port/IIS port>`
+
For example,
+
`> $cert = “abc123abc123abc123abc123”`
+
`> $guid = [guid]::NewGuid().ToString("B")`
+
`> netsh http add sslcert ipport=0.0.0.0:8146 certhash=$cert appid="$guid"` `clientcertnegotiation=enable verifyclientcertrevocation=disable`
+
`> $guid = [guid]::NewGuid().ToString("B")`
+
`> netsh http add sslcert ipport=0.0.0.0:8145 certhash=$cert appid="$guid"` `clientcertnegotiation=enable verifyclientcertrevocation=disable`
+ 
`> netsh http show sslcert ipport=0.0.0.0:8146`
+
`> netsh http show sslcert ipport=0.0.0.0:8145`

. To access permission to the CA certificate, add the SnapCenter’s default IIS web server user "*IIS AppPool\SnapCenter*" in the certificate permission list by performing the following steps to access the newly procured CA certificate.
.. Go to the Microsoft management console (MMC), and then click *File* > *Add/Remove SnapIn*.
.. In the Add or Remove Snap-ins window, select *Certificates* and then click *Add*.
.. In the Certificates snap-in window, select the *Computer account* option, and then click *Finish*.
.. Click *Console Root* > *Certificates – Local Computer* > *Personal* > *Certificates*.
.. Select the SnapCenter certificate. 
.. To start the add user\permission wizard, right-click on the CA certificate and select *All Tasks* > *Manage private keys*.
.. Click on *Add*, on Select users and groups wizard change the location to local computer name  (top most in the hierarchy)
.. Add the IIS AppPool\SnapCenter user, give full control permissions.

. For *CA certificate IIS permission*, add the new DWORD registry keys entry in SnapCenter Server from the following path:
+
In the windows registry editor, traverse to the below mentioned path,
+
`HKey_Local_Machine\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\SecurityProv  
 ders\SCHANNEL`

. Create new DWORD registry key entry under the context of SCHANNEL registry configuration.
+
`SendTrustedIssuerList = 0`
+
`ClientAuthTrustMode = 2`

== Configure SnapCenter Windows plug-in for Two-way SSL communication

You should configure SnapCenter Windows plug-in for two-way SSL communication using PowerShell commands.

.Before you begin

Ensure that the CA certificate thumbprint is available.

.Steps

. To bind the port, perform the following actions on Windows plug-in host for SMCore port 8145 (default).
.. Remove the existing SnapCenter self-signed certificate port binding using the following PowerShell command.
+
`> netsh http delete sslcert ipport=0.0.0.0:<SMCore port>`
+
For example,
+
`> netsh http delete sslcert ipport=0.0.0.0:8145`

.. Bind the newly procured CA certificate with the SMCore port.
+
`> $cert = “<CA_certificate thumbprint>”`
+
`> $guid = [guid]::NewGuid().ToString("B")`
+
`> netsh http add sslcert ipport=0.0.0.0: <SMCore Port> certhash=$cert appid="$guid"`
`clientcertnegotiation=enable verifyclientcertrevocation=disable`
+
`> netsh http show sslcert ipport=0.0.0.0:<SMCore Port>`
+
For example,
+
`> $cert = “abc123abc123abc123abc123”`
+
`> $guid = [guid]::NewGuid().ToString("B")`
+
`> netsh http add sslcert ipport=0.0.0.0:8145 certhash=$cert appid="$guid"` `clientcertnegotiation=enable verifyclientcertrevocation=disable`
+
`> netsh http show sslcert ipport=0.0.0.0:8145`
