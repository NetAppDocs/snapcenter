If you are using SnapCenter with ONTAP Select or Cloud Volumes ONTAP platforms, you must install one or more SnapCenter capacity-based licenses.

*What you will need*

* You must log in as the SnapCenter Admin user.
* If you want to log in to the NetApp Support Site using SnapCenter to obtain your licenses, you must have the license serial numbers and valid NetApp Support Site credentials.
* If you are using a NetApp license file (NLF) to add your license, you must know the location of the license file.

*About this task*

You can perform the following tasks on the Settings page:

* Add a license.
* View license details to quickly locate information about each license.
* Modify a license when you want to replace the existing license, for example, to update the license capacity or to change the threshold notification settings.
* Delete a license when you want to replace an existing license or when the license is no longer required.
+
NOTE: The trial license (serial number ending with 50) cannot be deleted using the SnapCenter GUI. The trial license automatically gets overwritten when you add a procured SnapCenter Standard capacity-based licensed.
