[.lead]
You must create a storage virtual machine (SVM) connection and a credential before using PowerShell cmdlets to back up, restore, or clone IBM Db2 databases.

.Before you begin

* You should have prepared the PowerShell environment to execute the PowerShell cmdlets.
* You should have the required permissions in the Infrastructure Admin role to create storage connections.
* You should ensure that the plug-in installations are not in progress.
+
Host plug-in installations must not be in progress while adding a storage system connection because the host cache might not be updated and databases status might be displayed in the SnapCenter GUI as "`Not available for backup`" or "`Not on NetApp storage`".

* Storage system names should be unique.
+
SnapCenter does not support multiple storage systems with the same name on different clusters. Each storage system that is supported by SnapCenter should have a unique name and a unique data LIF IP address.

.Steps

. Click *SnapCenterPS* to launch the PowerShell Core.

. Create a new connection to the storage system by using the Add-SmStorageConnection cmdlet.
+
----
PS C:\> Add-SmStorageConnection -StorageType DataOntap -Type DataOntap -OntapStorage ‘scsnfssvm’ -Protocol Https -Timeout 60
----

. Create a new credential by using the Add-SmCredential cmdlet.
+
This example shows how to create a new credential named FinanceAdmin with Windows credentials:
+
----
PS C:\> Add-SmCredential -Name 'FinanceAdmin' -Type Linux -AuthenticationType PasswordBased -Credential db2hostuser -EnableSudoPrevileges:$true
----

. Add the IBM Db2 communication host to SnapCenter Server.
+
For Linux:
+
----
PS C:\> Add-SmHost -HostType Linux -HostName '10.232.204.61' -CredentialName 'defaultcreds'
----
For Windows:
+
----
PS C:\> Add-SmHost -HostType Windows -HostName '10.232.204.61' -CredentialName 'defaultcreds'
----
. Install the package and the SnapCenter Plug-in for IBM Db2 on the host.
+
For Linux:
+
----
PS C:\> Install-SmHostPackage -HostNames '10.232.204.61' -PluginCodes DB2
----
+
For Windows:
+
----
PS C:\> Install-SmHostPackage -HostNames '10.232.204.61' -PluginCodes DB2,SCW
----

. Set the path to the SQLLIB.
+
For Windows, Db2 plug-in will use the default path for SQLLIB folder: “C:\Program Files\IBM\SQLLIB\BIN”
+
If you want to override the default path, use the following command.
+
----
PS C:\> Set-SmConfigSettings -Plugin -HostName '10.232.204.61' -PluginCode DB2 -configSettings @{"DB2_SQLLIB_CMD"="<custom_path>\IBM\SQLLIB\BIN"}
