You can use the plug-in to create consistency group snapshots for resource groups. A consistency group is a container that can house multiple volumes so that you can manage them as one entity. A consistency group is simultaneous snapshots of multiple volumes, providing consistent copies of a group of volumes.

You can also specify the wait time for the storage controller to consistently group snapshots. The available wait time options are *Urgent*, *Medium*, and *Relaxed*. You can also enable or disable Write Anywhere File Layout (WAFL) sync during consistent group snapshot operation. WAFL sync improves the performance of a consistency group snapshot.
