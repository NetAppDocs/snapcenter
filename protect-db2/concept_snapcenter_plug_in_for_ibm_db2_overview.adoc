The SnapCenter Plug-in for SAP HANA Database is a host-side component of the NetApp SnapCenter software that enables application-aware data protection management of SAP HANA databases. The Plug-in for SAP HANA Database automates the backup, restore, and cloning of SAP HANA databases in your SnapCenter environment.

SnapCenter supports single container and multitenant database containers (MDC). You can use the Plug-in for SAP HANA Database in both Windows and Linux environments. The plug-in that is not installed on the HANA database host is known as the centralized host plug-in. The centralized host plug-in can manage multiple HANA databases across different hosts.

When the Plug-in for SAP HANA Database is installed, you can use SnapCenter with NetApp SnapMirror technology to create mirror copies of backup sets on another volume. You can also use the plug-in with NetApp SnapVault technology to perform disk-to-disk backup replication for standards compliance.
