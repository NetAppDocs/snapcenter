You should manually mount a database backup if you want to access the files in the backup.

* If you have an Automatic Storage Management (ASM) database instance in an NFS environment and want to mount the ASM backups, you must have added the ASM disk path /var/opt/snapcenter/sco/backup_*/*/*/*/* to the existing path defined in the asm_diskstring parameter.
* If you have an ASM database instance in an NFS environment and want to mount the ASM log backups as part of a recovery operation, you must have added the ASM disk path /var/opt/snapcenter/scu/clones/*/* to the existing path defined in the asm_diskstring parameter.
* If you want to mount to an alternate host, you must verify that the alternate host meets the following requirements:
 ** Same UID and GID as that of the original host
 ** Same Oracle version as that of the original host
 ** Same OS distribution and version as that of the original host

. In the left navigation pane, click *Resources*, and then select the appropriate plug-in from the list.
. In the Resources page, select either *Database* or *Resource Group* from the *View* list.
. Select the database either from the database details view or from the resource group details view.
+
The database topology page is displayed.

. From the Manage Copies view, select *Backups* either from the primary or secondary (mirrored or replicated) storage system.
. Select the backup from the table, and then click image:../media/mount_icon.gif[mount icon].
. In the Mount backups page, select the host on which you want to mount the backup from the *Choose the host to mount the backup* drop-down list.
+
The mount path /var/opt/snapcenter/sco/backup_mount/backup_name/database_name is displayed.
+
If you are mounting the backup of an ASM database, the mount path +diskgroupname_SID_backupid is displayed.

. Click *Mount*.
+
After mounting the backup, you can run the following command to retrieve the information related to the mounted backup: `./sccli Get-SmBackup -BackupName backup_name -ListMountInfo`
+
If you have mounted an ASM database, you can run the following command to retrieve the information related to the mounted backup: `./sccli Get-Smbackup -BackupNamediskgroupname_SID_backupid-listmountinfo`
+
To retrieve the backup ID, run the following command: `./sccli Get-Smbackup-BackupNamebackup_name`
