You must configure credentials that are used to perform data protection operations on Oracle databases.

* Review the different authentication methods for Oracle.
+
See the _Authentication methods for your credentials_ section in the _Installation and Setup Guide_.

* If you set up credentials for individual resource groups and the user name does not have full admin privileges, the user name must at least have resource group and backup privileges.

If you have enabled Oracle database authentication, a red lock icon is shown in the resources view. You must configure database credentials to be able to protect the database or add it to the resource group to perform data protection operations.

NOTE: If you specify incorrect details while creating a credential, an error message is displayed. You must click *Cancel*, and then retry.

. In the left navigation pane, click *Resources*, and then select the appropriate plug-in from the list.
. In the Resources page, select *Database* from the *View* list.
. Click image:../media/filter_icon.gif[], and then select the host name and the database type to filter the resources.
+
You can then click image:../media/filter_icon.gif[] to close the filter pane.

. Select the database, and then click *Database Settings* > *Configure Database*.
. In the Configure database settings section, from the *Use existing Credential* drop-down list, select the credential that should be used to perform data protection jobs on the Oracle database.
+
NOTE: The Oracle user should have sysdba privileges.
+
You can also create a credential by clicking image:../media/add_icon_configure_database.gif[add icon in configuring database screen].

. In the Configure ASM settings section, from the *Use existing Credential* drop-down list, select the credential that should be used to perform data protection jobs on the ASM instance.
+
NOTE: The ASM user should have sysasm privilege.
+
You can also create a credential by clicking image:../media/add_icon_configure_database.gif[add icon in configuring database screen].

. In the Configure RMAN catalog settings section, from the *Use existing credential* drop-down list, select the credential that should be used to perform data protection jobs on the Oracle Recovery Manager (RMAN) catalog database.
+
You can also create a credential by clicking image:../media/add_icon_configure_database.gif[add icon in configuring database screen].
+
In the *TNSName* field, enter the Transparent Network Substrate (TNS) file name that will be used by the SnapCenter Server to communicate with the database.

. In the *Preferred RAC Nodes* field, specify the Real Application Cluster (RAC) nodes preferred for backup.
+
The preferred nodes might be one or all cluster nodes where the RAC database instances are present. The backup operation is triggered only on these preferred nodes in the order of preference.
+
In RAC One Node, only one node is listed in the preferred nodes, and this preferred node is the node where the database is currently hosted.
+
After failover or relocation of RAC One Node database, refreshing of resources in the SnapCenterResources page will remove the host from the *Preferred RAC Nodes* list where the database was earlier hosted. The RAC node where the database is relocated will be listed in *RAC Nodes* and will need to be manually configured as the preferred RAC node.

. Click *OK*.
