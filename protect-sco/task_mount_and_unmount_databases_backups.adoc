You can mount a single or multiple data and log only backups if you want to access the files in the backup. You can either mount the backup to the same host where the backup was created or to a remote host having same type of Oracle and host configurations. If you have manually mounted the backups, you should manually unmount the backups after completing the operation. At any given instance, a backup of a database can be mounted to any one of the host. While performing an operation, you can mount only a single backup.

//Included the below info for BURT 1348035 for 4.5
NOTE: In a Flex ASM setup, you cannot perform mount operation on Leaf nodes if the cardinality is less than the number nodes in the RAC cluster.

== Mount a database backup
You should manually mount a database backup if you want to access the files in the backup.

*What you will need*

* If you have an Automatic Storage Management (ASM) database instance in an NFS environment and want to mount the ASM backups, you should have added the ASM disk path _/var/opt/snapcenter/sco/backup_*/_*_/_*_/_*_/_*_ to the existing path defined in the asm_diskstring parameter.
* If you have an ASM database instance in an NFS environment and want to mount the ASM log backups as part of a recovery operation, you should have added the ASM disk path _/var/opt/snapcenter/scu/clones/_*_/_*_ to the existing path defined in the asm_diskstring parameter.
* In the asm_diskstring parameter, you should configure _AFD:*_ if you are using ASMFD or configure _ORCL:*_ if you are using ASMLIB.

NOTE: For information on how to edit the asm_diskstring parameter, see https://kb.netapp.com/Advice_and_Troubleshooting/Data_Protection_and_Security/SnapCenter/Disk_paths_are_not_added_to_the_asm_diskstring_database_parameter[How to add disk paths to asm_diskstring^].

* You should configure the ASM credentials and the ASM port if it differs from that of the source database host while mounting the backup.
* If you want to mount to an alternate host, you must verify that the alternate host meets the following requirements:
 ** Same UID and GID as that of the original host
 ** Same Oracle version as that of the original host
 ** Same OS distribution and version as that of the original host
 ** For NVMe, NVMe util should be installed

*Steps*

. In the left navigation pane, click *Resources*, and then select the appropriate plug-in from the list.
. In the Resources page, select either *Database* or *Resource Group* from the *View* list.
. Select the database either from the database details view or from the resource group details view.
+
The database topology page is displayed.

. From the Manage Copies view, select *Backups* either from the primary or secondary (mirrored or replicated) storage system.
. Select the backup from the table, and then click image:../media/mount_icon.gif[mount icon].
. In the Mount backups page, select the host on which you want to mount the backup from the *Choose the host to mount the backup* drop-down list.
+
The mount path _/var/opt/snapcenter/sco/backup_mount/backup_name/database_name_ is displayed.
+
If you are mounting the backup of an ASM database, the mount path +diskgroupname_SID_backupid is displayed.

. Click *Mount*.

*After you finish*

* You can run the following command to retrieve the information related to the mounted backup:
+
`./sccli Get-SmBackup -BackupName backup_name -ListMountInfo`

* If you have mounted an ASM database, you can run the following command to retrieve the information related to the mounted backup:
+
`./sccli Get-Smbackup -BackupNamediskgroupname_SID_backupid-listmountinfo`

* To retrieve the backup ID, run the following command:
+
`./sccli Get-Smbackup-BackupNamebackup_name`
+
The information regarding the parameters that can be used with the command and their descriptions can be obtained by running Get-Help _command_name_.

== Unmount a database backup

You can manually unmount a mounted database backup when you no longer want to access files on the backup.

*Steps*

. In the left navigation pane, click *Resources*, and then select the appropriate plug-in from the list.
. In the Resources page, select either *Database* or *Resource Group* from the *View* list.
. Select the database either from the database details view or from the resource group details view.
+
The database topology page is displayed.

. Select the backup that is mounted, and then click image:../media/unmount_icon.gif[unmount icon].
. Click *OK*.
