Define a backup strategy to ensure that you have the means to successfully restore or clone your databases.

Your service-level agreement (SLA), recovery time objective (RTO), and recovery point objective (RPO) largely determine your backup strategy. 

* SLA defines the level of service expected and addresses service-related issues like the availability and performance of the service.
* RTO defines the time a business process must be restored after a disruption in service.
* RPO defines the age of the files that must be recovered from backup storage for regular operations to resume after a failure.
