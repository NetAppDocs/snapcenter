You can back up the resource group containing only application volumes or a mix of application volumes and database. A backup operation on the resource group is performed on all resources defined in the resource group.

If the resource group has multiple application volumes, all the application volumes should either have SnapMirror or SnapVault replication policy.

*About this task*

By default, consistency group (CG) backups are created. If you want to create volume based backups, you should set the value of *EnableOracleNdvVolumeBasedBackup* to true in the _web.config_ file.

*Steps*

. In the left navigation pane, click *Resources*, and then select the Oracle Database plug-in from the list.
. In the Resources page, select *Resource Group* from the *View* list.
+
You can search the resource group either by entering the resource group name in the search box, or by clicking *image:../media/filter_icon.gif[]*, and then selecting the tag. You can then click *image:../media/filter_icon.gif[]* to close the filter pane.

. In the Resource Groups page, select the resource group that you want to back up, and then click *Back up Now*.
. In the Backup page, perform the following steps:
 .. If you have associated multiple policies with the resource group, from the *Policy* drop-down list, select the policy that you want to use for backup.
+
If the policy selected for the on-demand backup is associated with a backup schedule, the on-demand backups will be retained based on the retention settings specified for the schedule type.

 .. Click *Backup*.
. Monitor the operation progress by clicking *Monitor* > *Jobs*.
+
NOTE: Verification operation will be performed only for the databases and not for the application volumes.
