SnapCenter enables you to perform different types of restore operations for Oracle databases.

Before restoring the database, backups are validated to identify whether any files are missing when compared to the actual database files.

== Full restore

* Restores only the datafiles
* Restores only the control files
* Restores the datafiles and control files
* Restores datafiles, control files, and redo log files in Data Guard standby and Active Data Guard standby databases

== Partial restore

* Restores only the selected tablespaces
* Restores only the selected pluggable databases (PDBs)
* Restores only the selected tablespaces of a PDB
