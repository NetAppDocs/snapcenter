You should manage the password of SPL keystore and its certificate, configure the CA certificate, configure  root or intermediate certificates to SPL trust-store, and configure CA signed key pair to SPL trust-store  with SnapCenter Plug-in Loader service to activate the installed digital certificate.

IMPORTANT: SPL uses the file 'keystore.jks', which is located at ‘/var/opt/snapcenter/spl/etc’ both as its trust-store and key-store.

== Manage password for SPL keystore and alias of the CA signed key pair in use

*Steps*

. You can retrieve SPL keystore default password from SPL property file.
+
It is the value corresponding to the key 'SPL_KEYSTORE_PASS'.

. Change the keystore password:
+
    keytool -storepasswd -keystore keystore.jks

. Change the password for all aliases of private key entries in the keystore to the same password used for the keystore:
+
  keytool -keypasswd -alias "<alias_name>" -keystore keystore.jks

+
Update the same for the key SPL_KEYSTORE_PASS in spl.properties file.
.  Restart the service after changing the password.

NOTE: Password for SPL keystore and for all the associated alias password of the private key should be same.

== Configure root or intermediate certificates to SPL trust-store

You should configure the root or intermediate certificates without the private key to SPL trust-store.

*Steps*

. Navigate to the folder containing the SPL keystore: _/var/opt/snapcenter/spl/etc_.

. Locate the file 'keystore.jks'.

. List the added certificates in the keystore:

 keytool -list -v -keystore keystore.jks

. Add a root or intermediate certificate:

 keytool -import -trustcacerts -alias <AliasNameForCerticateToBeImported> -file /<CertificatePath> -keystore keystore.jks

. Restart the service after configuring the root or intermediate certificates to SPL trust-store.

NOTE: You should add the root CA certificate and then the intermediate CA certificates.

== Configure CA signed key pair to SPL trust-store

You should configure the CA signed key pair to the SPL trust-store.

*Steps*

. Navigate to the folder containing the SPL's keystore /var/opt/snapcenter/spl/etc.

. Locate the file 'keystore.jks'.

. List the added certificates in the keystore:

 keytool -list -v -keystore keystore.jks

. Add the CA certificate having both private and public key.

 keytool -importkeystore -srckeystore <CertificatePathToImport> -srcstoretype pkcs12 -destkeystore keystore.jks -deststoretype JKS

. List the added certificates in the keystore.

 keytool -list -v -keystore keystore.jks

.  Verify that the keystore contains the alias corresponding to the new CA certificate, which was added to the keystore.

. Change the added private key password for CA certificate to the keystore password.
+
Default SPL keystore password is the value of the key SPL_KEYSTORE_PASS in spl.properties file.

  keytool -keypasswd -alias "<aliasNameOfAddedCertInKeystore>" -keystore keystore.jks

. If the alias name in the CA certificate is long and contains space or special characters ("*",","), change the alias name to a simple name:

  keytool -changealias -alias "<OrignalAliasName>" -destalias "<NewAliasName>" -keystore keystore.jks

. Configure the alias name from the keystore located in spl.properties file.
+
Update this value against the key SPL_CERTIFICATE_ALIAS.

. Restart the service after configuring the CA signed key pair to SPL trust-store.

== Configure certificate revocation list (CRL) for SPL

You should configure the CRL for SPL

*About this task*

* SPL will look for the CRL files in a pre-configured directory.
* Default directory for the CRL files for SPL is _/var/opt/snapcenter/spl/etc/crl_.

*Steps*

. You can modify and update the default directory in spl.properties file against the key SPL_CRL_PATH.
. You can place more than one CRL file in this directory.
+
The incoming certificates will be verified against each CRL.
