SnapCenter enables you to perform different types of recovery operations for Oracle databases.

* The database up to the last transaction (all logs)
* The database up to a specific system change number (SCN)
* The database up to a specific date and time
+
You must specify the date and time for recovery based on the database host's time zone.

SnapCenter also provides the No recovery option for Oracle databases.

NOTE: The plug-in for Oracle database does not support recovery if you have restored using a backup that was created with the database role as standby. You must always perform manual recovery for physical standby databases.
