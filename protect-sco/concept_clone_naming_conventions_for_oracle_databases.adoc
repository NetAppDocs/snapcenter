From SnapCenter 3.0, the naming convention used for clones of file systems is different from the clones of ASM disk groups.

* The naming convention for SAN or NFS file systems is FileSystemNameofsourcedatabase_CLONESID.
* The naming convention for ASM disk groups is SC_HASHCODEofDISKGROUP_CLONESID.
+
HASHCODEofDISKGROUP is an automatically generated number (2 to 10 digits) that is unique for each ASM disk group.
