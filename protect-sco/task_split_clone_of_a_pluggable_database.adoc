[.lead]
You can use SnapCenter to split a cloned pluggable database (PDB).

*About this task*

If you created a backup of the target CDB where the PDB is cloned, when you split the PDB clone, the cloned PDB is also removed from all the backups of the target CDB containing the cloned PDB.

NOTE: The PDB clones are not displayed in the inventory or resources view.

*Steps*

. In the left navigation pane, click *Resources*, and then select the appropriate plug-in from the list.
. Select the source container database (CDB) from the resource or resource group view.
. From the Manage Copies view, select *Clones* either from the primary or secondary (mirrored or replicated) storage systems.
. Select the PDB clone (targetCDB:PDBClone) and then click image:../media/split_cone.gif[].
. Review the estimated size of the clone that is to be split and the required space available on the aggregate, and then click *Start*.
. Monitor the operation progress by clicking *Monitor* > *Jobs*.
