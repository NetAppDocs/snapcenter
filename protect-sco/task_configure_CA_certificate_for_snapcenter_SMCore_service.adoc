You should configure the CA certificate for SnapCenter SMCore service to activate the installed digital certificate.

You should perform this task on the SnapCenter Server and all the plug-in hosts where CA certificates are already deployed.

*Steps*

. Remove the existing certificate binding with SMCore default port 8145, by running the following command:

  netsh http delete sslcert ipport=0.0.0.0:<SMCore Port>

. Bind the newly installed certificate with the Windows host plug-in services, by running the following command:

  > $cert = “<certificate thumbprint>”
  > $guid = [guid]::NewGuid().ToString("B")
  > netsh http add sslcert ipport=0.0.0.0: <SMCore Port> certhash=$cert appid="$guid"
