SnapCenter 2.0 and later releases allow a non-root user to install the SnapCenter Plug-ins Package for Linux and to start the plug-in process. You should configure sudo privileges for the non-root user to provide access to several paths.

*What you will need*

* Sudo 1.8.7 or later.
* Ensure that the non-root user is part of the Oracle installation group.
* Edit the _/etc/ssh/sshd_config_ file to configure the message authentication code algorithms: MACs hmac-sha2-256 and MACs hmac-sha2-512.
+
Restart the sshd service after updating the configuration file.
+
Example:

----
#Port 22
#AddressFamily any
#ListenAddress 0.0.0.0
#ListenAddress ::
#Legacy changes
#KexAlgorithms diffie-hellman-group1-sha1
#Ciphers aes128-cbc
#The default requires explicit activation of protocol
Protocol 2
HostKey/etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key
MACs hmac-sha2-256

*About this task*

You should configure sudo privileges for the non-root user to provide access to the following paths:

* /tmp/sc-plugin-installer/snapcenter_linux_host_plugin.bin
* /custom_location/NetApp/snapcenter/spl/installation/plugins/uninstall
* /custom_location/NetApp/snapcenter/spl/bin/spl

*Steps*

. Log in to the Linux host on which you want to install the SnapCenter Plug-ins Package for Linux.
. Add the following lines to the /etc/sudoers file by using the visudo Linux utility.

Cmnd_Alias SCCMD = sha224:checksum_value== /home/SUDO_USER/.sc_netapp/snapcenter_linux_host_plugin.bin,

_non_root_user_ is the name of the non-root user that you created.
+
You can obtain the checksum value from the *oracle_checksum.txt* file, which is located at _C:\ProgramData\NetApp\SnapCenter\Package Repository_.
+
If you have specified a custom location, the location will be _custom_path\NetApp\SnapCenter\Package Repository_.
+
IMPORTANT: The example should be used only as a reference for creating your own data.

*Best Practice:* For security reasons, you should remove the sudo entry after completing every installation or upgrade.
