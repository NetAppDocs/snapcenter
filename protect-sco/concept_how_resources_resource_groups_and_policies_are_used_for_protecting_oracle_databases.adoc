Before you use SnapCenter, it is helpful to understand basic concepts related to the backup, clone, and restore operations you want to perform.

* Resources are typically Oracle databases in SnapCenter.
* A SnapCenterresource group is a collection of resources on a host or cluster.
+
When you perform an operation on a resource group, you perform that operation on the resources defined in the resource group.
+
The resource groups were formerly known as datasets.

* The policies specify the backup frequency, copy retention, replication, scripts, and other characteristics of data protection operations.
+
When you create a resource group, you select one or more policies for that group. You can also select a policy when you perform a backup on demand for a single resource. You can also perform scheduled backups for single resources and resource groups.

Think of a resource group as defining _what_ you want to protect and when you want to protect it in terms of day and time. Think of a policy as defining _how_ you want to protect it.

If you are backing up all databases of a host, for example, you might create a resource group that includes all of the databases in the host. You could then attach two policies to the resource group: a daily policy and an hourly policy. When you create the resource group and attach the policies, you might configure the resource group to perform a full backup daily and another schedule that performs log backups hourly.

The following image illustrates the relationship between resources, resource groups, and policies for databases:
