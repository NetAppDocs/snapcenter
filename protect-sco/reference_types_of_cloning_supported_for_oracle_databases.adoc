In an Oracle database environment, SnapCenter supports cloning of a database backup. You can clone the backup from primary and secondary storage systems.

The SnapCenter Server uses NetApp FlexClone technology to clone backups.

You can refresh a clone by running the "`Refresh-SmClone`" command. This command creates a backup of the database, deletes the existing clone, and creates a clone with the same name.

NOTE: The clone refresh operation can only be performed using the UNIX commands.
