You can delete the clone of a pluggable database (PDB) if you no longer require.

If you created a backup of the target CDB where the PDB is cloned, when you delete the PDB clone, the cloned PDB is also removed from the backup of the target CDB.

NOTE: The PDB clones are not displayed in the inventory or resources view.

*Steps*

. In the left navigation pane, click *Resources*, and then select the appropriate plug-in from the list.
. Select the source container database (CDB) from the resource or resource group view.
. From the Manage Copies view, select *Clones* either from the primary or secondary (mirrored or replicated) storage systems.
. Select the PDB clone (targetCDB:PDBClone) and then click image:../media/delete_icon.gif[].
. Click *OK*.
