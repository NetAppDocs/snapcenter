The backup workflow includes planning, identifying the resources for backup, creating backup policies, creating resource groups and attaching policies, creating backups, and monitoring the operations.

* You should have added the storage system connections and created the credential using the commands Add-SmStorageConnection and Add-SmCredential.
* You should have established the connection session with the SnapCenter Server using the command Open-SmConnection.
+
You can have only one SnapCenter account login session and the token is stored in the user home directory.
+
NOTE: The connection session is valid only for 24 hours. However, you can create a token with the TokenNeverExpires option to create a token that never expires and the session will always be valid.

You should execute the following commands to establish the connection with the SnapCenter Server, discover the Oracle database instances, add policy and resource group, backup and verify the backup.

The information regarding the parameters that can be used with the command and their descriptions can be obtained by running helpcommand_name. Alternatively, you can also refer to the _Command Reference Guide_.

. Initiate a connection session with the SnapCenter Server for a specified user: Open-SmConnection
. Perform host resources discovery operation: Get-SmResources
. Configure Oracle database credentials and preferred nodes for backup operation of a Real Application Cluster (RAC) database: Configure-SmOracleDatabase
. Create a backup policy: Add-SmPolicy
. Retrieve the information about the secondary (SnapVault or SnapMirror) storage location : Get-SmSecondaryDetails
+
This command retrieves the primary to secondary storage mapping details of a specified resource. You can use the mapping details to configure the secondary verification settings while creating a backup resource group.

. Add a resource group to SnapCenter: Add-SmResourceGroup
. Create a backup: New-SmBackup.
+
You can poll the job using the WaitForCompletion option. If this option is specified, then the command continues to poll the server until the completion of the backup job.

. Retrieve the logs from SnapCenter: Get-SmLogs
