You can use the Add Host page to add hosts, and then install the SnapCenter Plug-ins Package for Linux or SnapCenter Plug-ins Package for AIX. The plug-ins are automatically installed on the remote hosts.

*About this task*

You can add a host and install plug-in packages either for an individual host or for a cluster. If you are installing the plug-in on a cluster (Oracle RAC), the plug-in is installed on all of the nodes of the cluster. For Oracle RAC One Node, you should install the plug-in on both active and passive nodes.

You should be assigned to a role that has the plug-in install and uninstall permissions, such as the SnapCenter Admin role.

NOTE: You cannot add a SnapCenter Server as a plug-in host to another SnapCenter Server.

*Steps*

. In the left navigation pane, click *Hosts*.
. Verify that the *Managed Hosts* tab is selected at the top.
. Click *Add*.
. In the Hosts page, perform the following actions:
+
|===
| For this field... | Do this...

a|
Host Type
a|
Select *Linux* or *AIX* as the host type.

The SnapCenter Server adds the host, and then installs the Plug-in for Oracle Database and the Plug-in for UNIX if the plug-ins are not already installed on the host.
a|
Host name
a|
Enter the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) or the IP address of the host.

SnapCenter depends on the proper configuration of the DNS. Therefore, the best practice is to enter the FQDN.

You can enter the IP addresses or FQDN of one of the following:

 ** Stand-alone host
 ** Any node in the Oracle Real Application Clusters (RAC) environment
+
NOTE: Node VIP or scan IP is not supported

+
If you are adding a host by using SnapCenter and the host is part of a subdomain, you must provide the FQDN.
a|
Credentials
a|
Either select the credential name that you created or create new credentials.

The credential must have administrative rights on the remote host. For details, see the information about creating credentials.

You can view details about the credentials by positioning the cursor over the credential name that you specified.

NOTE: The credentials authentication mode is determined by the host type that you specify in the Add Host wizard.
|===

. In the Select Plug-ins to Install section, select the plug-ins to install.
. (Optional) Click *More Options*.

| For this field...| Do this...

a|
Port
a|
Either retain the default port number or specify the port number.

The default port number is 8145. If the SnapCenter Server was installed on a custom port, that port number will be displayed as the default port.

NOTE: If you manually installed the plug-ins and specified a custom port, you must specify the same port. Otherwise, the operation fails.

a|
Installation Path
a|
The default path is _/opt/NetApp/snapcenter_.

You can optionally customize the path.

a|
Add all hosts in the Oracle RAC
a|
Select this check box to add all the cluster nodes in an Oracle RAC.

//Included the below info for BURT 1348035 for 4.5
In a Flex ASM setup, all the nodes irrespective of whether it is a Hub or Leaf node, will be added.
a|
Skip preinstall checks
a|
Select this check box if you already installed the plug-ins manually and you do not want to validate whether the host meets the requirements for installing the plug-in.
|===

. Click *Submit*.
+
If you have not selected the Skip prechecks checkbox, the host is validated to verify whether the host meets the requirements for installing the plug-in.
+
NOTE: The precheck script does not validate the plug-in port firewall status if it is specified in the firewall reject rules.

+
Appropriate error or warning messages are displayed if the minimum requirements are not met. If the error is related to disk space or RAM, you can update the web.config file located at _C:\Program Files\NetApp\SnapCenter WebApp_ to modify the default values. If the error is related to other parameters, you should fix the issue.
+
NOTE: In an HA setup, if you are updating web.config file, you must update the file on both nodes.

. Verify the fingerprint, and then click *Confirm and Submit*.
+
In a cluster setup, you should verify the fingerprint of each of the nodes in the cluster.
+
NOTE: SnapCenter does not support ECDSA algorithm.

+
NOTE: Fingerprint verification is mandatory even if the same host was added earlier to SnapCenter and the fingerprint was confirmed.

. Monitor the installation progress.
+
The installation-specific log files are located at _/custom_location/snapcenter/logs_.

*After you finish*

All the databases on the host are automatically discovered and displayed in the Resources page. If nothing is displayed, click *Refresh Resources*.
