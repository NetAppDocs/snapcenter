A resource group is a collection of resources on a host or cluster. A backup operation on the resource group is performed on all resources defined in the resource group.

You can back up a resource group on demand from the Resources page. If a resource group has a policy attached and a schedule configured, then backups occur automatically according to the schedule.

.Steps

. In the left navigation pane, select *Resources*, and the appropriate plug-in from the list.
. In the Resources page, select *Resource Group* from the *View* list.
. Enter the resource group name in the search box, or click image:../media/filter_icon.gif[Filter icon], and select the tag.
+
Click image:../media/filter_icon.gif[Filter icon] to close the filter pane.

. In the Resource Group page, select the resource group to back up.
+
NOTE: If you have a federated resource group with two databases and one has data on non-NetApp storage, the backup operation is aborted even though the other database is on NetApp storage.

. In the Backup page, perform the following steps:
 .. If you have multiple policies associated with the resource group, select the backup policy you want to use from the *Policy* drop-down list.
+
If the policy selected for the on-demand backup is associated with a backup schedule, the on-demand backups will be retained based on the retention settings specified for the schedule type.

 .. Select *Backup*.
. Monitor the progress by selecting *Monitor > Jobs*.

.After you finish

* In AIX setup, you can use the `lkdev` command to lock and the `rendev` command to rename the disks on which the database that was backed up was residing.
+
Locking or renaming of devices will not affect the restore operation when you restore using that backup.

* If the backup operation fails because database query execution time exceeded the timeout value, you should change the value of the ORACLE_SQL_QUERY_TIMEOUT and ORACLE_PLUGIN_SQL_QUERY_TIMEOUT parameters by running the `Set-SmConfigSettings` cmdlet:
+
After modifying the value of the parameters, restart the SnapCenter Plug-in Loader (SPL) service by running the following command `/opt/NetApp/snapcenter/spl/bin/spl restart`

* If the file is not accessible and the mount point is unavailable during the verification process, the operation might fail with error code DBV-00100 specified file. You should modify the values of the VERIFICATION_DELAY_ and VERIFICATION_RETRY_COUNT parameters in sco.properties.
+
After modifying the value of the parameters, restart the SnapCenter Plug-in Loader (SPL) service by running the following command `/opt/NetApp/snapcenter/spl/bin/spl restart`
