SnapCenter Software is a simple, centralized, scalable platform that provides application-consistent data protection for applications, databases, host file systems, and VMs running on ONTAP systems anywhere in the Hybrid Cloud.

SnapCenter leverages NetApp Snapshot, SnapRestore, FlexClone, SnapMirror, and SnapVault technologies to provide the following:

* Fast, space-efficient, application-consistent, disk-based backups
* Rapid, granular restore, and application-consistent recovery
* Quick, space-efficient cloning

SnapCenter includes both SnapCenter Server and individual lightweight plug-ins. You can automate deployment of plug-ins to remote application hosts, schedule backup, verification, and clone operations, and monitor all data protection operations.

SnapCenter can be deployed in the following ways:

* On premise to protect the following:
** Data that is on ONTAP FAS, AFF, or All SAN Array (ASA) primary systems and replicated to ONTAP FAS, AFF, or ASA secondary systems
** Data that is on ONTAP Select primary systems
** Data that is on ONTAP FAS, AFF, or ASA primary and secondary systems and protected to local StorageGRID object storage 

* On premise in a Hybrid Cloud to protect the following:
** Data that is on ONTAP FAS, AFF, or ASA primary systems and replicated to Cloud Volumes ONTAP
** Data that is on ONTAP FAS, AFF, or ASA primary and secondary systems and protected to object and archive storage in cloud (using BlueXP backup and recovery integration)

* In a public cloud to protect the following:
** Data that is on Cloud Volumes ONTAP (formerly ONTAP Cloud) primary systems
** Data that is on Amazon FSX for ONTAP
** Data that is on primary Azure NetApp Files (Oracle, Microsoft SQL, and SAP HANA)

SnapCenter includes the following key features:

* Centralized, application-consistent data protection
+
Data protection is supported for Microsoft Exchange Server, Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle Databases on Linux or AIX, SAP HANA database, IBM Db2, PostgreSQL, MySQL, and Windows Host Filesystems running on ONTAP systems.
+
Data protection is also supported for other standard or custom applications and databases by providing a framework to create user-defined SnapCenter plug-ins. This enables data protection for other applications and databases from the same single-pane-of-glass. By leveraging this framework, NetApp has released SnapCenter plug-ins for MongoDB, Storage, MaxDB, Sybase ASE, ORASCPM. Apart from this, you can create your own plug-in using the developer's guide.

* Policy-based backups
+
Policy-based backups leverage NetApp Snapshot technology to create fast, space-efficient, application-consistent, disk-based backups. Optionally, you can automate protection of these backups to secondary storage by updates to existing protection relationships.

* Back ups for multiple resources
+
You can back up multiple resources (applications, databases, or host file systems) of the same type, at the same time, by using SnapCenter resource groups.

* Restore and recovery
+
SnapCenter provides rapid, granular restores of backups and application-consistent, time-based recovery. You can restore from any destination in the Hybrid Cloud.

* Cloning
+
SnapCenter provides quick, space-efficient, application-consistent cloning, which enables accelerated software development. You can clone on any destination in the Hybrid Cloud.

* SnapMirror active sync (initially released as SnapMirror Business Continuity [SM-BC])
+
SnapMirror active sync enables business services to continue operating even through a complete site failure, supporting applications to fail over transparently using a secondary copy. Neither manual intervention nor additional scripting is required to trigger a failover with SnapMirror active sync.
+
The plug-ins supported for this feature are SnapCenter Plug-in for SQL Server, SnapCenter Plug-in for Windows, SnapCenter Plug-in for Oracle database, SnapCenter Plug-in for SAP HANA database, SnapCenter Plug-in for Microsoft Exchange Server, and SnapCenter Plug-in for Unix.
+
NOTE: To support host initiator proximity in SnapCenter, it's value, either source or destination should be set in ONTAP.
+
SnapMirror active sync functionality not supported in SnapCenter:

** If you convert the existing asymmetric SnapMirror active sync workloads to symmetric by changing the policy on the SnapMirror active sync relationships from _automatedfailover_ to _automatedfailoverduplex_ in ONTAP, the same is not supported in SnapCenter.
** If there are backups of a resource group (already protected in SnapCenter) and then storage policy is changed on the SnapMirror active sync relationships from _automatedfailover_ to _automatedfailoverduplex_ in ONTAP, the same is not supported in SnapCenter.
+
For more information on SnapMirror active sync refer https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/smbc/index.html[SnapMirror active sync overview]
+

The SnapCenter Server includes a web server, a centralized HTML5-based user interface, PowerShell cmdlets, REST APIs, and the SnapCenter repository.

SnapCenter Server supports both Microsoft Windows and Linux (RHEL 8.x, RHEL 9.x, SLES 15 SP5)

If you are using the SnapCenter Plug-ins Package for Linux or the SnapCenter Plug-ins Package for AIX, schedules are executed centrally using the Quartz scheduler.

* For SnapCenter Plug-in for Oracle Database, the host agent that runs on the SnapCenter Server host communicates with the SnapCenter Plug-in Loader (SPL) that runs on the Linux or AIX host to perform different data protection operations.
* For SnapCenter Plug-in for SAP HANA Database and SnapCenter Custom Plug-ins, the SnapCenter Server communicates with these plug-ins through the SCCore agent that runs on the host.

The SnapCenter Server and plug-ins communicate with the host agent using HTTPS. Information about SnapCenter operations is stored in the SnapCenter repository.

NOTE: SnapCenter supports disjoint namespace for Windows hosts. If you face issues when using disjoint namespace, refer to https://kb.netapp.com/mgmt/SnapCenter/SnapCenter_is_unable_to_discover_resources_when_using_disjoint_namespace[SnapCenter is unable to discover resources when using disjoint namespace].

You should run the following commands to know the status of the SnapCenter components running on Linux host:

* `systemctl status snapmanagerweb`
* `systemctl status scheduler`
* `systemctl status smcore`
* `systemctl status nginx`
* `systemctl status rabbitmq-server`
