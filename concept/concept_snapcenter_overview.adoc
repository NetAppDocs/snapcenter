SnapCenter Software is a simple, centralized, scalable platform that provides application-consistent data protection for applications, databases, host file systems, and VMs running on ONTAP systems anywhere in the Hybrid Cloud.

SnapCenter leverages NetApp Snapshot, SnapRestore, FlexClone, SnapMirror, and SnapVault technologies to provide the following:

* Fast, space-efficient, application-consistent, disk-based backups
* Rapid, granular restore, and application-consistent recovery
* Quick, space-efficient cloning

SnapCenter includes both SnapCenter Server and individual lightweight plug-ins. You can automate deployment of plug-ins to remote application hosts, schedule backup, verification, and clone operations, and monitor all data protection operations.

SnapCenter can be deployed in the following ways:

* On premise to protect the following:
** Data that is on ONTAP FAS or AFF primary systems and replicated to ONTAP FAS or AFF secondary systems
** Data that is on ONTAP Select primary systems
** Data that is on ONTAP FAS or AFF primary & secondary systems and protected to local StorageGRID object storage (using NetApp BlueXP cloud backup integration)

* On premise in a Hybrid Cloud to protect the following:
** Data that is on ONTAP FAS or AFF primary systems and replicated to Cloud Volumes ONTAP
** Data that is on ONTAP FAS or AFF primary and secondary systems and protected to object and archive storage in cloud (using NetApp BlueXP Cloud Backup integration)

* In a public cloud to protect the following:
** Data that is on Cloud Volumes ONTAP (formerly ONTAP Cloud) primary systems
** Data that is on Amazon FSX for ONTAP

SnapCenter includes the following key features:

* Centralized, application-consistent data protection
+
Data protection is supported for Microsoft Exchange Server, Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle Databases on Linux or AIX, SAP HANA database, and Windows Host Filesystems running on ONTAP systems.
+
Data protection is also supported for other standard or custom applications and databases by providing a framework to create user-defined SnapCenter plug-ins. This enables data protection for other applications and databases from the same single-pane-of-glass. By leveraging this framework, NetApp has released SnapCenter custom plug-ins for IBM DB2, MongoDB, MySQL etc. on the NetApp Automation Store.

* Policy-based backups
+
Policy-based backups leverage NetApp Snapshot copy technology to create fast, space-efficient, application-consistent, disk-based backups. Optionally, you can automate protection of these backups to secondary storage by updates to existing protection relationships.

* Back ups for multiple resources
+
You can back up multiple resources (applications, databases, or host file systems) of the same type, at the same time, by using SnapCenter resource groups.

* Restore and recovery
+
SnapCenter provides rapid, granular restores of backups and application-consistent, time-based recovery. You can restore from any destination in the Hybrid Cloud.

* Cloning
+
SnapCenter provides quick, space-efficient, application-consistent cloning, which enables accelerated software development. You can clone on any destination in the Hybrid Cloud.

* Single user management graphical user interface (GUI)
+
The SnapCenter GUI provides a single, one-stop interface for managing backups and clones of a resource in any destination in the Hybrid Cloud.

* REST APIs, Windows cmdlets, UNIX commands
+
SnapCenter includes REST APIs for most functionality for integration with any orchestration software, and use of Windows PowerShell cmdlets and command-line interface.
+

* Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for security and delegation.
* Repository database with High Availability
+
SnapCenter provides a built-in repository database with High Availability to store all backup metadata.

* Automated push install of plug-ins
+
You can automate a remote push of SnapCenter plug-ins from the SnapCenter Server host to application hosts.

* High Availability
// Removed load balancing as per Manohar's comments
+
High availability for SnapCenter is set up using external load balancer (F5). Up to two nodes are supported within the same datacenter.
// Changed the description as per Manohar's comments

* Disaster Recovery (DR)
+
You can recover the SnapCenter Server in the event of disasters like resource corruption or server crash.

== SnapCenter architecture

The SnapCenter platform is based on a multitiered architecture that includes a centralized management server (SnapCenter Server) and a SnapCenter plug-in host.

SnapCenter supports multisite data center. The SnapCenter Server and the plug-in host can be at different geographical locations.

SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere, formerly NetApp Data Broker, is a standalone virtual appliance that supports SnapCenter data protection operations on virtualized databases and file systems.

== SnapCenter server

The SnapCenter Server includes a web server, a centralized HTML5-based user interface, PowerShell cmdlets, REST APIs, and the SnapCenter repository.

SnapCenter enables high availability and horizontal scaling across multiple SnapCenter Servers within a single user interface. You can accomplish high availability by using external load balancer (F5). For larger environments with thousands of hosts, adding multiple SnapCenter Servers can help balance the load.

// Updated as per Manohar's comments
* If you are using the SnapCenter Plug-ins Package for Windows, the host agent runs on the SnapCenter Server and Windows plug-in host. The host agent executes the schedules natively on the remote Windows host, or for Microsoft SQL Servers, the schedule is executed on the local SQL instance.
+
The SnapCenter Server communicates with the Windows plug-ins through the host agent.

* If you are using the SnapCenter Plug-ins Package for Linux or the SnapCenter Plug-ins Package for AIX, schedules are executed on the SnapCenter Server as Windows task schedules.
 ** For SnapCenter Plug-in for Oracle Database, the host agent that runs on the SnapCenter Server host communicates with the SnapCenter Plug-in Loader (SPL) that runs on the Linux or AIX host to perform different data protection operations.
 ** For SnapCenter Plug-in for SAP HANA Database and SnapCenter Custom Plug-ins, the SnapCenter Server communicates with these plug-ins through the SCCore agent that runs on the host.

The SnapCenter Server and plug-ins communicate with the host agent using HTTPS.

Information about SnapCenter operations is stored in the SnapCenter repository.
