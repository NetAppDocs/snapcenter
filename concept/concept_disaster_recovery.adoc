You can recover the SnapCenter Server in the event of disasters like resource corruption or server crash using the SnapCenter disaster recovery feature.  You can recover SnapCenter repository, server schedules, and server configuration components.

You can also recover the SnapCenter Plug-in for SQL Server and SnapCenter Plug-in for SQL Server storage.

Following are the types of disaster recovery (DR) :

* *SnapCenter Server DR*
+
SnapCenter Server data will be backed up and recovered irrespective of whether any plug-in has been added or managed by SnapCenter Server.
+
Secondary SnapCenter Server should be installed on the same installation directory and on the same port as the primary SnapCenter Server.
+
For Multi-factor authentication (MFA), when the DR restore is performed for Snapcenter Server, close all the  browser tabs and reopen a browser to login again. This will clear the existing or active session cookies and ensures that the correct configuration data is updated.
+
SnapCenter disaster recovery functionality uses REST APIs to backup SnapCenter Server.

* *SnapCenter Plug-in and Storage DR*
+
DR is supported only for SnapCenter Plug-in for SQL Server. When the SnapCenter Plug-in for SQL Server is down, switch to a different SQL host and recover the data by performing few steps.

SnapCenter uses ONTAP SnapMirror technology to replicate data.   It can be used to replicate data to a secondary site for DR and keep it in sync. A failover can be initiated by breaking the replication relationship in SnapMirror. During failback the synchronization can be reversed and data from the DR site can be replicated back to the primary location.
