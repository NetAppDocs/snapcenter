* SnapCenter uses security algorithms that are compliant with the Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS).
* SnapCenter supports using the authorized CA certificates provided by the customer.
* SnapCenter 4.1.1 or later supports Transport Layer Security (TLS) 1.2 communication with ONTAP. You can also use TLS 1.2 communication between clients and servers.
* SnapCenter is installed inside your company's firewall to enable access to the SnapCenter Server and to enable communication between the SnapCenter Server and the plug-ins.
* SnapCenter API and operation access uses tokens encrypted with AES encryption, which expire after 24 hours.
* SnapCenter integrates with Windows Active Directory for login and role-based access control (RBAC) that govern access permissions.
* SnapCenter PowerShell cmdlets are session secured.
* After a default period of 15 minutes of inactivity, SnapCenter warns you that you will be logged out in 5 minutes. After 20 minutes of inactivity, SnapCenter logs you out, and you must log in again. You can modify the log out period.

== CA Certificate Overview

The SnapCenter Server installer enables the Centralized SSL Certificate Support during installation. To enhance the secured communication between the server and the plug-in, SnapCenter supports using the authorized CA certificates provided by the customer.

You should deploy CA certificates after installing the SnapCenter Server and the  respective plug-ins.
For more information, see link:../install/reference_generate_CA_certificate_CSR_file.html[Generate CA Certificate CSR file^].

You can also deploy CA certificate for SnapCenter plug-in for VMware vSphere. For more information, see https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/sc-plugin-vmware-vsphere/scpivs44_manage_snapcenter_plug-in_for_vmware_vsphere.html#create-and-import-certificates[Create and import certificates^].
