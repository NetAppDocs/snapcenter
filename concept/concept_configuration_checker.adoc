The Configuration Checker enables you to validate the configuration of SnapCenter Server and the plug-in hosts. The Configuration Checker identifies the issues in your environment and provides recommendations, corrective actions, and notifications to resolve the issues.

After installing SnapCenter Server when you log in for the first time, a default configuration checker schedule is created with the following characteristics:

* You cannot create additional schedules for SnapCenter Server.
* You cannot delete the default schedule.
* Only a SnapCenter administrator can modify or disable the default schedule.

After you add a plug-in host to the SnapCenter Server, Configuration Checker is triggered and alerts are generated. You can create a Configuration Checker schedule for the plug-in host, which you can modify, delete, or disable.

The _Installation and Setup Guide_ contains more information.
