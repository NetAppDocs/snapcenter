Describes how to upgrade SnapCenter Server and the plug-ins.

Each release of SnapCenter contains an updated SnapCenter Server and plug-in package updates. Plug-in package updates are distributed with the SnapCenter installer. You can configure SnapCenter to check for available updates. Then, you must install them.
