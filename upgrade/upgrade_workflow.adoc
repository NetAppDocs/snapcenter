Each release of SnapCenter contains an updated SnapCenter Server and plug-in package. Plug-in package updates are distributed with the SnapCenter installer. You can configure SnapCenter to check for available updates.

The workflow shows the different tasks required to upgrade the SnapCenter Server and the Plug-in packages.

IMPORTANT: If you are on a SnapCenter version that is prior to n-2, you need to perform a rolling upgrade. For example, if you are on SnapCenter version 4.3.x and want to upgrade to 4.6.x, you should first upgrade to 4.5.x and then do a rolling upgrade to 4.6.x.
