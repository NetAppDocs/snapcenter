Each release of SnapCenter contains an updated SnapCenter Server and plug-in package. Plug-in package updates are distributed with the SnapCenter installer. You can configure SnapCenter to check for available updates.

The workflow shows the different tasks required to upgrade the SnapCenter Server and the Plug-in packages.
