The plug-in packages are distributed as part of the SnapCenter upgrade.

The upgrade procedure places your Windows, Linux, or AIX host in "`maintenance`" mode, which prevents the host from running any scheduled jobs.

*What you will need*

* If you are a non-root user with access to the Linux machines, you should update the _/etc/sudoers_ file with the latest checksum values before performing the upgrade operation.
* By default SnapCenter detects JAVA_HOME from the environment. If you want to use a fixed JAVA_HOME and if you are upgrading the plug-ins on a Linux host, you should manually add the SKIP_JAVAHOME_UPDATE parameter in the _spl.properties_ file located at _/var/opt/snapcenter/spl/etc/_ and set the value to TRUE.
+
The value of JAVA_HOME gets updated when the plug-in is upgraded or when the SnapCenter plug-in loader (SPL) service restarts. Before upgrading or restarting the SPL, if you add the SKIP_JAVAHOME_UPDATE parameter and set the value to TRUE, the value of JAVA_HOME is not updated.

* You should have backed up all the SnapCenter configuration files that you have modified either on the SnapCenter Server host or the plug-in host.
+
Examples of SnapCenter configuration files: SnapDriveService.exe.config, SMCoreServiceHost.exe.config, and so on.

*Steps*

. In the left navigation pane, click *Hosts* > *Managed Hosts*.
. Upgrade the hosts by performing one of the following tasks:
  * If the Overall Status column displays "`Upgrade available`" for one of the hosts, click the host name and perform the following:
    .. Click *More Options*.
    .. Select *Skip prechecks* if you do not want to validate whether the host meets the requirements to upgrade the plug-in.
    .. Click *Upgrade*.
  * If you want to upgrade multiple hosts, select all the hosts, click image:../media/more_icon.gif[], and then click *Upgrade* > *OK*.
+
NOTE: All the plug-ins in the package gets selected, but only the plug-ins that were installed with the earlier version of SnapCenter are upgraded, and the remaining plug-ins are not installed. You must use the *Add plug-ins* option to install any new plug-in.

If you have not selected the *Skip prechecks* check box, the host is validated to see if it meets the requirements to install the plug-in. If the minimum requirements are not met, appropriate error or warning messages are displayed. After fixing the issue, click *Upgrade*.

NOTE: If the error is related to disk space or RAM, you can update either the web.config located at C:\Program Files\NetApp\SnapCenter WebApp, or the PowerShell config files located at C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\Modules\SnapCenter\ to modify the default values. If the error is related to remaining parameters then you must fix the issue, and then validate the requirements again.
