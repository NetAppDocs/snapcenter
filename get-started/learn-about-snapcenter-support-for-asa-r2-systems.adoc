ASA r2 storage systems are supported beginning with SnapCenter 6.1. https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/asa-r2/get-started/learn-about.html[Learn more about ASA r2 systems]

SnapCenter leverages REST APIs to perform all operations on ASA r2 systems, which do not support ZAPIs.

NOTE: After upgrading to SnapCenter (server and plug-ins) 6.2 and ONTAP 9.17.1, as part of the first scheduled backup SnapCenter will transform all the flat consistency groups to hierarchical consistency groups.

*Operations supported by SnapCenter for ASA r2 systems*

* Creating primary backups of applications over VMDK
* Moving hierarchical consistency group snapshots to secondary storage system
* Restoring the backups from primary and secondary storage systems to the original host or to the alternate host
** In-place restore from both primary and secondary storage systems using VMware vMotion
** Connect and copy restore from both primary and secondary storage systems
* Cloning the backups to the original host or to the alternate host
* Raw Device Mapping (RDM)
* Application volumes for Oracle
* SAP HANA NDV 
* LockVault
* Secondary provisioning of the log directory of SQL plug-in host

SnapCenter can discover or create ONTAP consistency groups. It can also provision and initialize SnapMirror relationships to the destination cluster for secondary protection.
