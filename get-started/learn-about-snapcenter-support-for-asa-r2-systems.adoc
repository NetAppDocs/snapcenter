ASA r2 storage systems are supported beginning with SnapCenter 6.1. https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/asa-r2/get-started/learn-about.html[Learn more about ASA r2 systems]

SnapCenter supports protection of applications running on physical systems and Virtual Machine File Systems (VMFS). SnapCenter uses REST APIs for all operations on ASA r2 systems. ASA r2 systems do not support ZAPIs.

NOTE: After you upgrade to SnapCenter 6.2 (server and plug-ins) and ONTAP 9.17.1, SnapCenter changes flat consistency groups to hierarchical consistency groups during the first scheduled backup.

*Operations supported by SnapCenter for ASA r2 systems*

* Creating primary backups of applications
* Moving hierarchical consistency group snapshots to secondary storage system
* Restoring backups from primary and secondary storage systems to the original or alternate host
** In-place restore from both primary and secondary storage systems using VMware vMotion
** Connect and copy restore from both primary and secondary storage systems
* Cloning the backups to the original host or to the alternate host
* Raw Device Mapping (RDM)
* Application volumes for Oracle
* SAP HANA NDV 
* LockVault
* Secondary provisioning of the log directory of SQL plug-in host

SnapCenter discovers or creates ONTAP consistency groups. It sets up SnapMirror relationships on the destination cluster for secondary protection.
