[.lead]
SnapCenter Software is a simple, centralized, scalable platform that provides application-consistent data protection for applications, databases, host file systems, and VMs running on ONTAP systems anywhere in the Hybrid Cloud.

SnapCenter leverages NetApp Snapshot, SnapRestore, FlexClone, SnapMirror, and SnapVault technologies to provide the following:

* Fast, space-efficient, application-consistent, disk-based backups
* Rapid, granular restore, and application-consistent recovery
* Quick, space-efficient cloning

SnapCenter includes both SnapCenter Server and individual lightweight plug-ins. You can automate deployment of plug-ins to remote application hosts, schedule backup, verification, and clone operations, and monitor all data protection operations.

SnapCenter can be installed either on on-premise or on a public cloud to protect data.

* On premise to protect the following:
** Data that is on ONTAP FAS, AFF, or ASA primary systems and replicated to ONTAP FAS, AFF, or ASA secondary systems
** Data that is on ONTAP Select primary systems
** Data that is on ONTAP FAS, AFF, or ASA primary and secondary systems and protected to local StorageGRID object storage 
** Data that is on ONTAP ASA r2 primary and secondary systems

* On premise in a Hybrid Cloud to protect the following:
** Data that is on ONTAP FAS, AFF, or ASA primary systems and replicated to Cloud Volumes ONTAP
** Data that is on ONTAP FAS, AFF, or ASA primary and secondary systems and protected to object and archive storage in cloud (using BlueXP backup and recovery integration)

* In a public cloud to protect the following:
** Data that is on Cloud Volumes ONTAP (formerly ONTAP Cloud) primary systems
** Data that is on Amazon FSX for ONTAP
** Data that is on primary Azure NetApp Files (Oracle, Microsoft SQL, and SAP HANA)

== Key features

SnapCenter provides the following key features:

* Centralized, application-consistent data protection of different applications
+
Data protection is supported for Microsoft Exchange Server, Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle Databases on Linux or AIX, SAP HANA database, IBM Db2, PostgreSQL, MySQL, and Windows Host Filesystems running on ONTAP systems.
+
Data protection is also supported for other standard or custom applications and databases by providing a framework to create user-defined SnapCenter plug-ins. This enables data protection for other applications and databases from the same single-pane-of-glass. By leveraging this framework, NetApp has released SnapCenter plug-ins for MongoDB, Storage, MaxDB, Sybase ASE, ORASCPM. You can also create your own plug-in using the developer's guide. 

* Policy-based backups
+
Policy-based backups leverage NetApp Snapshot technology to create fast, space-efficient, application-consistent, disk-based backups. Optionally, you can automate protection of these backups to secondary storage by updates to existing protection relationships.

* Back ups for multiple resources
+
You can back up multiple resources (applications, databases, or host file systems) of the same type, at the same time, by using SnapCenter resource groups.

* Restore and recovery
+
SnapCenter provides rapid, granular restores of backups and application-consistent, time-based recovery. You can restore from any destination in the Hybrid Cloud.

* Cloning
+
SnapCenter provides quick, space-efficient, application-consistent cloning, which enables accelerated software development. You can clone on any destination in the Hybrid Cloud.

* Single user management graphical user interface (GUI)
+
SnapCenter provides a GUI that is a single, one-stop interface for managing backups and clones of a resource in any destination in the Hybrid Cloud.

* REST APIs, Windows cmdlets, UNIX commands
+
SnapCenter provides REST APIs for most functionality for integration with any orchestration software, and use of Windows PowerShell cmdlets and command-line interface.

* Centralized data protection dashboard and reporting
* Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for security and delegation
* A built-in repository database with high-availability to store all backup metadata
* Automated push install of plug-ins
* High Availability
* Disaster Recovery (DR)
* SnapLock https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/snaplock/[Learn More]
* SnapMirror active sync (initially released as SnapMirror Business Continuity [SM-BC])
* Synchronous mirroring https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/e-series-santricity/sm-mirroring/overview-mirroring-sync.html[Learn More]

== SnapCenter architecture and components

The SnapCenter platform is based on a multitiered architecture that includes a centralized management server and a plug-in host. SnapCenter supports multisite data center. The SnapCenter server host and the plug-in host can be at different geographical locations.

SnapCenter includes the SnapCenter Server, the SnapCenter Plug-in package for Windows, and the SnapCenter Plug-In Package for Linux. Each package contains plug-ins for various applications and infrastructure components.

=== SnapCenter Server

The SnapCenter Server supports Microsoft Windows and Linux (RHEL 8.x, RHEL 9.x, SLES 15 SP5) operating systems. SnapCenter server includes a web server, a centralized HTML5-based user interface, PowerShell cmdlets, REST APIs, and the SnapCenter repository.

The SnapCenter Server and plug-ins communicate with the host agent using HTTPS. Information about SnapCenter operations is stored in the SnapCenter repository.

=== SnapCenter plug-ins

The SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere supports crash-consistent and VM-consistent backup and restore operations for virtual machines (VMs), datastores, and Virtual Machine Disks (VMDKs), and it supports the SnapCenter application-specific plug-ins to protect application-consistent backup and restore operations for virtualized databases and file systems.

If your database or filesystem is stored on VMs, or if you want to protect VMs and datastores, you must deploy the SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere virtual appliance. For information, refer https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/sc-plugin-vmware-vsphere/index.html[SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere documentation^].

=== SnapCenter repository

The SnapCenter repository, sometimes referred to as the NSM database, stores information and metadata for every SnapCenter operation.

MySQL Server repository database is installed by default when you install the SnapCenter Server. If MySQL Server is already installed and you are doing a fresh installation of SnapCenter Server, you should uninstall MySQL Server.

SnapCenter supports MySQL Server 8.0.37 or later as the SnapCenter repository database. If you were using an earlier version of MySQL Server with an earlier release of SnapCenter, during SnapCenter upgrade, the MySQL Server is upgraded to 8.0.37 or later.

The SnapCenter repository stores the following information and metadata:

* Backup, clone, restore, and verification metadata
* Reporting, job, and event information
* Host and plug-in information
* Role, user, and permission details
* Storage system connection information
