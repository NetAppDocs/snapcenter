[.lead]
SnapCenter software is a simple, centralized, and scalable platform for application-consistent data protection. It protects applications, databases, host file systems, and VMs on ONTAP systems in the Hybrid Cloud.

SnapCenter uses NetApp Snapshot, SnapRestore, FlexClone, SnapMirror, and SnapVault technologies to provide:

* Fast, space-efficient, application-consistent, disk-based backups
* Fast, detailed restore, and application-consistent recovery
* Quick, space-efficient cloning

SnapCenter includes SnapCenter Server and lightweight plug-ins. You can automate plug-in deployment to remote application hosts, schedule backup, verification, and clone operations, and monitor data protection operations.

You can install SnapCenter either on on-premises or on a public cloud to protect data.

* On-premises to protect the following:
** Data that is on ONTAP FAS, AFF, or ASA primary systems and replicated to ONTAP FAS, AFF, or ASA secondary systems
** Data that is on ONTAP Select primary systems
** Data that is on ONTAP FAS, AFF, or ASA primary and secondary systems and protected to local StorageGRID object storage 
** Data that is on ONTAP ASA r2 primary and secondary systems

* On-premises in a Hybrid Cloud to protect the following:
** Data that is on ONTAP FAS, AFF, or ASA primary systems and replicated to Cloud Volumes ONTAP
** Data that is on ONTAP FAS, AFF, or ASA primary and secondary systems and protected to object and archive storage in cloud (using BlueXP backup and recovery integration)

* In a public cloud to protect the following:
** Data that is on Cloud Volumes ONTAP (formerly ONTAP Cloud) primary systems
** Data that is on Amazon FSX for ONTAP
** Data that is on primary Azure NetApp Files (Oracle, Microsoft SQL, and SAP HANA)

== Key features

+
You can back up multiple resources (applications, databases, or host file systems) of the same type at once using SnapCenter resource groups.

* Restore and recovery
+
SnapCenter provides rapid, granular restores of backups and application-consistent, time-based recovery. You can restore from any destination in the Hybrid Cloud.

+
SnapCenter provides REST APIs for most functionality for integration with any orchestration software, and use of Windows PowerShell cmdlets and command-line interface.

* Centralized data protection dashboard and reporting
* Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for security and delegation
* A built-in repository database with high-availability to store all backup metadata
* Automated push install of plug-ins
* High Availability
* Disaster Recovery (DR)

== SnapCenter architecture and components

SnapCenter uses a layered design with a central management server and plug-in hosts. The server and plug-in hosts can be in different locations.

SnapCenter includes the SnapCenter Server, the SnapCenter Plug-in package for Windows, and the SnapCenter Plug-In Package for Linux. Each package contains plug-ins for various applications and infrastructure components.

=== SnapCenter Server

The SnapCenter Server supports Microsoft Windows and Linux (RHEL 8.x, RHEL 9.x, SLES 15 SP5) operating systems. SnapCenter server includes a web server, a centralized HTML5-based user interface, PowerShell cmdlets, REST APIs, and the SnapCenter repository.

SnapCenter stores information about its operations in the SnapCenter repository.

=== SnapCenter plug-ins

Each SnapCenter plug-in supports specific environments, databases, and applications.

The SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere supports crash-consistent and VM-consistent backup and restore operations for virtual machines (VMs), datastores, and Virtual Machine Disks (VMDKs). It also supports application-consistent backup and restore operations for virtualized databases and file systems.

To protect databases, filesystems, VMs, or datastores on VMs, deploy the SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere appliance. For information, refer https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/sc-plugin-vmware-vsphere/index.html[SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere documentation^].

=== SnapCenter repository

The SnapCenter repository, sometimes referred to as the NSM database, stores information and metadata for every SnapCenter operation.

The SnapCenter Server installation installs the MySQL Server repository database by default. If you have already installed MySQL Server and want to perform a fresh installation of SnapCenter Server, you must uninstall MySQL Server.

SnapCenter supports MySQL Server 8.0.37 or later as the SnapCenter repository database. If you use an earlier version of MySQL Server with an earlier release of SnapCenter, the SnapCenter upgrade process upgrades MySQL Server to version 8.0.37 or later.

The SnapCenter repository stores the following information and metadata:

* Backup, clone, restore, and verification metadata
* Reporting, job, and event information
* Host and plug-in information
* Role, user, and permission details
* Storage system connection information
