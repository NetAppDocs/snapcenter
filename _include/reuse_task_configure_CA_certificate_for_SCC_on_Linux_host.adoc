You should manage the password of the custom plug-ins keystore and its certificate, configure the CA certificate, configure  root or intermediate certificates to the custom plug-ins trust-store, and configure CA signed key pair to custom plug-ins trust-store  with SnapCenter Custom Plug-ins service to activate the installed digital certificate.

Custom plug-ins uses the file 'keystore.jks', which is located at _/opt/NetApp/snapcenter/scc/etc_ both as its trust-store and key-store.

== Manage password for custom plug-in keystore and alias of the CA signed key pair in use

*Steps*

. You can retrieve custom plug-in keystore default password from custom plug-in agent property file.
+
It is the value corresponding to the key 'KEYSTORE_PASS'.

. Change the keystore password:
+
    keytool -storepasswd -keystore keystore.jks

. Change the password for all aliases of private key entries in the keystore to the same password used for the keystore:
+
  keytool -keypasswd -alias "alias_name_in_cert" -keystore keystore.jks

+
Update the same for the key KEYSTORE_PASS in _agent.properties_ file.
.  Restart the service after changing the password.

[NOTE]

Password for custom plug-in keystore and for all the associated alias password of the private key should be same.

== Configure root or intermediate certificates to custom plug-in trust-store

You should configure the root or intermediate certificates without the private key to custom plug-in trust-store.

*Steps*

. Navigate to the folder containing the custom plug-in keystore:  /opt/NetApp/snapcenter/scc/etc.

. Locate the file 'keystore.jks'.

. List the added certificates in the keystore:
+
`keytool -list -v -keystore keystore.jks`

. Add a root or intermediate certificate:

  keytool -import -trustcacerts -alias myRootCA -file /root/USERTrustRSA_Root.cer -keystore keystore.jks

. Restart the service after configuring the root or intermediate certificates to custom plug-in trust-store.

[NOTE]

You should add the root CA certificate and then the intermediate CA certificates.

== Configure CA signed key pair to custom plug-in trust-store

You should configure the CA signed key pair to the custom plug-in trust-store.

*Steps*

. Navigate to the folder containing the custom plug-in keystore /opt/NetApp/snapcenter/scc/etc.

. Locate the file 'keystore.jks'.

. List the added certificates in the keystore:
+
`keytool -list -v -keystore keystore.jks`

. Add the CA certificate having both private and public key.
+
`keytool -importkeystore -srckeystore /root/snapcenter.ssl.test.netapp.com.pfx -srcstoretype pkcs12 -destkeystore keystore.jks -deststoretype JKS`

. List the added certificates in the keystore.
+
`keytool -list -v -keystore keystore.jks`

.  Verify that the keystore contains the alias corresponding to the new CA certificate, which was added to the keystore.

. Change the added private key password for CA certificate to the keystore password.
+
Default custom plug-in keystore password is the value of the key KEYSTORE_PASS in agent.properties file.

  keytool -keypasswd -alias "alias_name_in_CA_cert" -keystore keystore.jks

. If the alias name in the CA certificate is long and contains space or special characters ("*",","), change the alias name to a simple name:

    keytool -changealias -alias "long_alias_name" -destalias "simple_alias" -keystore keystore.jks

. Configure the alias name from CA certificate in agent.properties file.
+
Update this value against the key SCC_CERTIFICATE_ALIAS.

. Restart the service after configuring the CA signed key pair to custom plug-in trust-store.

== Configure certificate revocation list (CRL) for SnapCenter Custom Plug-ins

*About this task*

* SnapCenter Custom Plug-ins will search for the CRL files in a pre-configured directory.
* Default directory for the CRL files for SnapCenter Custom Plug-ins is ' opt/NetApp/snapcenter/scc/etc/crl'.

*Steps*

. You can modify and update the default directory in agent.properties file against the key CRL_PATH.
+
You can place more than one CRL file in this directory. The incoming certificates will be verified against each CRL.
