You should manage the password of the custom plug-ins keystore and its certificate, configure the CA certificate, configure  root or intermediate certificates to the custom plug-ins trust-store, and configure CA signed key pair to custom plug-ins trust-store with SnapCenter Custom Plug-ins service to activate the installed digital certificate.

Custom plug-ins uses the file _keystore.jks_, which is located at _C:\Program Files\NetApp\SnapCenter\Snapcenter Plug-in Creator\etc_ both as its trust-store and key-store.

== Manage password for custom plug-in keystore and alias of the CA signed key pair in use

*Steps*

. You can retrieve custom plug-in keystore default password from custom plug-in agent property file.
+
It is the value corresponding to the key _KEYSTORE_PASS_.

. Change the keystore password:
+
_keytool -storepasswd -keystore keystore.jks_
+
NOTE: If the "keytool" command is not recognized on the Windows command prompt, replace the keytool command with its complete path.
+
_C:\Program Files\Java\<jdk_version>\bin\keytool.exe" -storepasswd -keystore keystore.jks_

. Change the password for all aliases of private key entries in the keystore to the same password used for the keystore:
+
_keytool -keypasswd -alias "alias_name_in_cert" -keystore keystore.jks_
+
Update the same for the key KEYSTORE_PASS in _agent.properties_ file.
.  Restart the service after changing the password.
+
NOTE: Password for custom plug-in keystore and for all the associated alias password of the private key should be same.

== Configure root or intermediate certificates to custom plug-in trust-store

You should configure the root or intermediate certificates without the private key to custom plug-in trust-store.

*Steps*

. Navigate to the folder containing the custom plug-in keystore  _C:\Program Files\NetApp\SnapCenter\Snapcenter Plug-in Creator\etc_
. Locate the file 'keystore.jks'.
. List the added certificates in the keystore:
+
_keytool -list -v -keystore keystore.jks_

. Add a root or intermediate certificate:
+
_keytool -import -trustcacerts -alias myRootCA -file /root/USERTrustRSA_Root.cer -keystore keystore.jks_

. Restart the service after configuring the root or intermediate certificates to custom plug-in trust-store.

NOTE: You should add the root CA certificate and then the intermediate CA certificates.

== Configure CA signed key pair to custom plug-in trust-store

You should configure the CA signed key pair to the custom plug-in trust-store.

*Steps*

. Navigate to the folder containing the custom plug-in keystore _C:\Program Files\NetApp\SnapCenter\Snapcenter Plug-in Creator\etc_
. Locate the file _keystore.jks_.
. List the added certificates in the keystore:
+
_keytool -list -v -keystore keystore.jks_

. Add the CA certificate having both private and public key.
+
_keytool -importkeystore -srckeystore /root/snapcenter.ssl.test.netapp.com.pfx -srcstoretype pkcs12 -destkeystore keystore.jks -deststoretype JKS_

. List the added certificates in the keystore.
+
_keytool -list -v -keystore keystore.jks_

. Verify that the keystore contains the alias corresponding to the new CA certificate, which was added to the keystore.

. Change the added private key password for CA certificate to the keystore password.
+
Default custom plug-in keystore password is the value of the key KEYSTORE_PASS in agent.properties file.
+
_keytool -keypasswd -alias "alias_name_in_CA_cert" -keystore keystore.jks_

. Configure the alias name from CA certificate in _agent.properties_ file.
+
Update this value against the key SCC_CERTIFICATE_ALIAS.

. Restart the service after configuring the CA signed key pair to custom plug-in trust-store.

== Configure certificate revocation list (CRL) for SnapCenter Custom Plug-ins

*About this task*

* To download the latest CRL file for the related CA certificate see https://kb.netapp.com/Advice_and_Troubleshooting/Data_Protection_and_Security/SnapCenter/How_to_update_certificate_revocation_list_file_in_SnapCenter_CA_Certificate[How to update certificate revocation list file in SnapCenter CA Certificate].
* SnapCenter Custom Plug-ins will search for the CRL files in a pre-configured directory.
* Default directory for the CRL files for SnapCenter Custom Plug-ins is _'C:\Program Files\NetApp\SnapCenter\Snapcenter Plug-in Creator\ etc\crl'_.

*Steps*

. You can modify and update the default directory in _agent.properties_ file against the key CRL_PATH.
. You can place more than one CRL file in this directory.
+
The incoming certificates will be verified against each CRL.
