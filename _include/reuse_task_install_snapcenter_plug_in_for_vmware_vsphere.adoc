== Configure the CRL file

SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere looks for the CRL files in a pre-configured directory. Default directory of the CRL files for SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere is _/opt/netapp/config/crl_.

You can place more than one CRL file in this directory. The incoming certificates will be verified against each CRL.
