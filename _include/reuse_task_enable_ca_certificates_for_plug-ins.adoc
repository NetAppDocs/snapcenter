You should configure the CA certificates and deploy the CA certificates in the SnapCenter Server and the corresponding plug-in hosts.  You should enable the CA certificate validation for the plug-ins.

*Before you begin*

* You can enable or disable the CA certificates using the run Set-SmCertificateSettings cmdlet.
* You can display the certificate status for the plug-ins using the Get-SmCertificateSettings.

The information regarding the parameters that can be used with the cmdlet and their descriptions can be obtained by running Get-Help <command_name>. Alternatively, you can also refer the https://library.netapp.com/ecm/ecm_download_file/ECMLP2877143[SnapCenter Software Cmdlet Reference Guide].


*Steps*

. In the left navigation pane, click *Hosts*.
. In the Hosts page, click *Managed Hosts*.
. Select single or multiple plug-in hosts.
.	Click *More options*.
. Select *Enable Certificate Validation*.

*After you finish*

The Managed Hosts tab host displays a padlock and the color of the padlock indicates the status of the connection between SnapCenter Server and the plug-in host.

* The yellow color (default) indicates that there is no certificate enabled or assigned to the plug-in host.
* The green color indicates that the certificate is successfully validated.
* The red color indicates the certificate could not be validated.

NOTE: When the status is yellow or green, the data protection operations completes successfully.
