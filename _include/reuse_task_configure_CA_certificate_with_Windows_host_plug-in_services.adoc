You should configure the CA certificate with Windows host plug-in services to activate the installed digital certificate.

Perform the following steps on the SnapCenter Server and all the plug-in hosts where CA certificates are already deployed.

*Steps*

. Remove the existing certificate binding with SMCore default port 8145, by running the following command:
+
`> netsh http delete sslcert ipport=0.0.0.0:_<SMCore Port>`
+
For example:
+
  > netsh http delete sslcert ipport=0.0.0.0:8145

. Bind the newly installed certificate with the Windows host plug-in services, by running the following commands:
+
`> $cert = “_<certificate thumbprint>_”`
+
`> $guid = [guid]::NewGuid().ToString("B")`
+
`> netsh http add sslcert ipport=0.0.0.0: _<SMCore Port>_ certhash=$cert appid="$guid"`
+
For example:
+
  > $cert = “a909502dd82ae41433e6f83886b00d4277a32a7b”
  > $guid = [guid]::NewGuid().ToString("B")
  > netsh http add sslcert ipport=0.0.0.0:8145 certhash=$cert appid="$guid"
