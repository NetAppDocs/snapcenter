Windows Server 2012 or later enables you to create a group Managed Service Account (gMSA) that provides automated service account password management from a managed domain account.

*What you will need*

* You should have a Windows Server 2012 or later domain controller.
* You should have a Windows Server 2012 or later host, which is a member of the domain.

*Steps*

. Create a KDS root key to generate unique passwords for each object in your gMSA.
. For each domain, run the following command from the Windows domain controller: Add-KDSRootKey -EffectiveImmediately
. Create and configure your gMSA:
 .. Create a user group account.
 .. Add computer objects to the group.
 .. Use the user group you just created to create the gMSA.
+
For example,
+
  New-ADServiceAccount -name <ServiceAccountName> -DNSHostName <fqdn> -PrincipalsAllowedToRetrieveManagedPassword <group> -ServicePrincipalNames <SPN1,SPN2,â€¦>

 .. Run `Get-ADServiceAccount` command to verify the service account.
. Configure the gMSA on your hosts:
 .. Enable the Active Directory module for Windows PowerShell on the host where you want to use the gMSA account.
+
To do this, run the following command from PowerShell:

 .. Restart your host.
 .. Install the gMSA on your host by running the following command from the PowerShell command prompt: `Install-AdServiceAccount <gMSA>`
 .. Verify your gMSA account by running the following command: `Test-AdServiceAccount <gMSA>`
. Assign the administrative privileges to the configured gMSA on the host.
. Add the Windows host by specifying the configured gMSA account in the SnapCenter Server.
+
SnapCenter Server will install the selected plug-ins on the host and the specified gMSA will be used as the service log on account during the plug-in installation.
